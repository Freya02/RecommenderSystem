* Last year's HTC U11+. The U12+ looks to have dual rear and dual front cameras.

Are you curious about the blockchain-based HTC phone reported this week? Well, this is not that phone. It's another HTC phone expected on May 23: the flagship HTC U12+.


Want to know more? Noted gadget blogger Evan Blass posted photos and even what seems to be an entire three-page spec sheet (and embargo details) of the U12+.

The specs promise "new pressure-sensitive buttons" and an updated version of HTC's Edge Sense 2, which turns phone squeezes into actions and promises squeezes that can control phone or access apps, smart rotate and screen dim actions, back key and navigation bars, double-taps for mini screen modes and customizable gestures. It looks to have the same curved "liquid surface" design of the HTC U11+ last year.
