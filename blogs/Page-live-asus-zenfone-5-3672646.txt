LIVE: How to Watch Asus Zenfone 5 Launch Live Stream & Live Blog

Today at MWC 2018 Asus will announce the Zenfone 5. Follow the announcement live with Tech Advisor


By Marie Black | 27 Feb 2018


Tonight at 7.30pm CET (6.30pm here in the UK), Asus will announce new products at MWC 2018. We don't know that it's a Zenfone 5, but it's pretty obvious given that there's a huge 5 in the teaser and MWC is a mobile devices tradeshow.


And such a device is rumoured, of course. The Zenfone 5 is expected to come in three versions, Lite, Standard and Max, with most recent rumours focusing on the Lite. It could have dual-cameras front and rear, as well as a Snapdragon 660 processor, 4GB of RAM and a full-HD 18:9 display. We'll provide full details tomorrow.
