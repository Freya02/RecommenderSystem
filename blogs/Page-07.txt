Honor 9 Lite Quad-Lens Smartphone Pushes Huawei into Europe 
by Neil Mawston | Feb 07, 2018

Huawei this week introduced its first Honor-branded Lite smartphone for the Western European (and global... but not US) market.

The Honor 9 Lite is a mid-tier smartphone with Android Oreo, gesture-control, trendy 18:9 screen, and four cameras (13MP / 2MP) for enhanced mobile photography. It is a feature-rich model at a competitive price-point. The device will be available commercially across Western Europe from February 9th, 2018.

The cost-friendly, feature-packed P9 Lite will help to perk up Huawei's smartphone marketshare in key countries such as the UK or Germany during this year.

Our Smartphone Model Tracker (SMT) service notes Huawei has already had considerable success with its sister P10 Lite device last year. Huawei is bigger than many realize. For example, P10 Lite captured an impressive 5% share of all smartphones shipped in Spain in the second half of 2017.
