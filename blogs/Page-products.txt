so powerful


With a huge 5000 mAh battery, you get up to 1.5 days of battery life.* And when it’s time to power up, don’t slow down. The turbopower™ charger gives you up to 6 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging.§


impressive display


Enjoy a 6" Max Vision display you can use comfortably with just one hand. Do less scrolling on websites. Get a crazy-wide landscape view of games. Even multitask effortlessly on a split screen – if you’re into that sort of thing.


sharp photos


The 12 MP rear camera focuses in an instant with laser autofocus technology and lets in more light with large, 1.25 μm pixels. Turn it around and the 8 MP selfie camera snaps you and your friends in superb lighting, day or night, with the dedicated front flash.


stand out


Designed with a reflective wave pattern and an arched back for a look as great as it feels. On the front, the rounded corner glass panel provides smooth edges, and in the back, the aerial is hidden away.


worry-free enjoyment


A water-repellent design safeguards your phone inside and out. So, don’t worry about accidental spills and splashes.**


exclusive interactions


Only motorola phones react to simple gestures to instantly reveal a function or communication you need at that moment. Customise which moto experiences you’d like to use by simply visiting the moto app on your new phone.


fits into your life


Engineered to save you time without sacrificing security, to amp up your favourite music, and to grow when you need it, so there’s no limit to your entertainment.


Smart, secure fingerprint reader


Touch the fingerprint reader to wake up and unlock your phone instantly, and lock it again when you're done. It’s discreetly located within the phone’s iconic logo, so you hardly know it’s there until you use it.


Crystal clear sound


With the front-ported speaker, hear conference calls and your favourite music and movies perfectly, even when the phone’s lying on its back.


You can have it all


Add up to 128 GB more photos, songs, and movies thanks to a dedicated microSD card slot. Now you don’t have to choose between adding a second SIM card for work or adding more storage.‡

Quick gestures

With Moto Actions, your simple gestures make everyday interactions more convenient. Whether you're chopping down twice to turn on the flashlight, or twisting your wrist to open the camera, you can do more with less effort.

Smarter screen

Don’t jump through hoops to stay in the loop. Moto Display gives you a quick preview of notifications and updates, so you can see what’s going on without unlocking your phone. Just give it a nudge to see what’s new, then reply to emails and texts without even unlocking your phone.
