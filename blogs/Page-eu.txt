VISION


Rebuilding trust, one phone at a time.


I’m excited to see EXODUS putting in the work to make blockchain and cryptocurrency technology secure and easy to use for the masses.


— Vitalik Buterin, Co-Founder of Ethereum


A Key step towards mass adoption is having crypto wallets that are both secure and easy to use. I’m excited to help HTC tackle this with the EXODUS phone.


— Charlie Lee, Creator of Litecoin


We’re excited about the upcoming release of the EXODUS, which will give users a streamlined way to interact with blockchain apps and crypto wallets. Like the EXODUS, the brave browser puts the user in charge of their data and in control of their Internet experience. User information is safely kept on-device and protected from centralized cloud platforms that can violate privacy and security.


— Brendan Eich, CEO & Co-founder of Brave Browser


Excited to be part of HTC's "crypto phone" team! Expect hardware within the phones to facilitate secure private key management, transparent gas payments when using Dapps and more.


— Dominic Williams, President & Chief Scientist of DFINITY


HTC EXODUS: The blockchain phone that could change the internet as we know it.


— Tech Radar


We see a world where people own their own identities and data, where everyone understands the concept and economics of digital property.


— Phil Chen, HTC


The phone has become more and more the modern person’s wallet. Like wallets of old, they are very personal and private: in them are our families, our personal identity, and our wealth. In this modern era of digital communications and commerce, we need wallets to be our personal agent to the digital world—to represent us faithfully, to secure us, and to extend our trust to others. The Exodus line of phones provides such a wallet agent, able to interact with the digital world on our behalf.


— Christopher Allen, Decentralized Identity & Blockchain Architect - Blockchain Commons
