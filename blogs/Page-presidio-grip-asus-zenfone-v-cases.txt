With an ultra-slim design and superior impact protection, Presidio ™ GRIP is a premium grip Asus ZenFone V case unlike any other. It’s designed like a fortress, with a protective perimeter to keep shock away from your Asus ZenFone V.


Presidio GRIP features the IMPACTIUM™ Shock Barrier, Speck’s innovative new shock-suppression technology that protects your device without adding unnecessary bulk. IMPACTIUM is a dynamic shock-absorbing material lining the interior of the case that absorbs and disperses shock from impact. IMPACTIUM absorbs 52% more shock from impact than traditional TPE rubber.


This material is formed into ridges on the inside perimeter of the case that compress on impact to absorb and disperse force before it reaches the device. The case’s hard exterior also works to disperse shock away from your phone.


Presidio GRIP cases feature a scratch-resistant matte finish with a range of elegant and vibrant colors.


Presidio GRIP is drop tested from 10 feet multiple times by a third-party laboratory to test its superior protection from an extreme height, so you can be confident it will hold up to everyday drops. All Speck cases, including Presidio GRIP, are lab tested for scratch resistance, chemical resistance, and precision fit.


Raised rubber ridges provide a no-slip grip.


Protection

  * 10-Foot Drop Tested. Our Presidio™ Asus ZenFone V cases have been dropped from a height of 10 feet multiple times by third-party laboratories to ensure they offer superior protection.
  * IMPACTIUM™ Shock Barrier. Speck’s innovative IMPACTIUM rubber lines the inside of the case and is formed into ridges that compress on impact to absorb and disperse shock.
  * Patented raised-bezel screen protection. IMPACTIUM raised bezel guards screen from direct drops onto phone face and prevents damage when lying flat.
  * Responsive button protection. IMPACTIUM protects volume and power buttons while maintaining true button responsiveness.
  * Perimeter port and camera protection. IMPACTIUM protects ports, microphone, and speakers from drops without compromising acoustics or interfering with port accessibility, camera lenses, or the camera flash.

Design

  * Dual-layer design. Presidio GRIP features a polycarbonate outer shell and inner IMPACTIUM rubber layer for robust protection.
  * Precision-engineered fit. Presidio GRIP is precision-engineered to fit your Asus ZenFone V perfectly.
  * No-slip grip. Raised rubber ridges provide a no-slip grip.

Quality

  * Scratch-resistant. New matte finish resists scratches and offers a modern style with a range of elegant and vibrant colors.
  * Lab-tested durability. All Speck cases are independently lab tested for multiple real-life situations to ensure your device is always protected. We test to protect against extreme drops, extreme temperatures, chemicals, antenna interference, cracks and abrasions, device bending, and more.
  * Lifetime warranty. This Presidio case comes with a lifetime limited warranty. For full terms visit: speckproducts.com/warranty
