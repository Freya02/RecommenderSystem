Xiaomi Mi A2 4G Smartphone

The Streaming Blog
August 15, 2018

The Xiaomi Mi A2 will be based on the Mi 6X. This means a metal construction will once again be present, with the front panel being adorned by a tall 6-inch display. Furthermore, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 660 will power the smartphone and it will be coupled with the choice of either 4GB or 6GB of RAM.


Greater display and better front camera


Against the Mi A1 model, Mi A2 brings a number of enhancements that start right on the front with a larger screen with a higher resolution. This year’s model has a 5.99 “display with a resolution of 1080 x 2160 pixels, a aspect ratio of 18: 9 and a fineness of 403 ppi. The screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 3.


The big upgrade has been met by fans of the selfies – Mi A2 has a front camera with a resolution of 20 Mpx (f / 1.8) above the screen.


Beautiful photos with a dual camera


Another enhancement can be found on the back, where there is a dual camera with 12 megapixel resolution (f / 1.8) and 20 megapixel (f / 1.8 brightness) with PDAF phase flash and LED flash.


In addition to the camera, a fast and reliable fingerprint reader was also found on the back of the camera. The back is metallic, making the phone look elegant and solid.


Sufficient performance


Changes were also made in the device’s bowels. The upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 replaced the eight-legged Snapdragon 660. It is “stacked” from four powerful Kryo 260 kernels up to 2.2 GHz and four Kryo 260 at 1.8 GHz. The graphics are provided by the Adreno 512 accelerator.


There are several combinations of memory and internal storage, and even the lowest specification is sufficient for the smooth running of the operating system and applications.
