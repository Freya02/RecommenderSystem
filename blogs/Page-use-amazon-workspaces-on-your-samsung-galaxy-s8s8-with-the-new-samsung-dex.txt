Use Amazon WorkSpaces on Your Samsung Galaxy S8/S8+ With the New Samsung DeX

by Jeff Barr | on 27 APR 2017 | in Launch, News | Permalink | Share

It is really interesting to watch as technology evolves and improves. For example, today’s mobile phones offer screens with resolution that rivals a high-end desktop, along with multiple connectivity options and portability.


Earlier this week I had the opportunity to get some hands-on experience with the brand-new Samsung Galaxy S8+ phone and a unique new companion device called the Samsung DeX Station. I installed the Amazon WorkSpaces client for Android tablet on the phone, entered the registration code for my WorkSpace, and logged in. You can see all of this in action in my new video:


DeX includes USB connectors for your keyboard and mouse, and can also communicate with them using Bluetooth. It also includes a cooling fan, a fast phone charger, plus HDMI and Ethernet ports (You can also use your phone’s cellular or Wi-Fi connections).


Bring it all together and you can get to your cloud-based desktop from just about anywhere. Travel light, use the TV / monitor in your hotel room, and enjoy full access to your corporate network, files, and other resources.


— Jeff;


PS – If you want to know more about my working environment, check out I Love my Amazon WorkSpace.
