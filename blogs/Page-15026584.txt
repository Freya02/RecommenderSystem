Oppo (via GSMArena)


I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: the cameras, particularly the front-facing cameras, are the most important part of a phone. With dual cameras slowly becoming more popular and a thing that people want, why shouldn’t we also have a dual-camera system on the front of our devices? Our selfies need love, too. Oppo is set to announce its new F3 and F3 Plus phones this week, which includes dual selfie cameras.


Although the devices aren’t supposed to be revealed until tomorrow, someone at Oppo accidentally published their retail page, and blogs like GSMArena spotted it. The setup includes a 16-megapixel camera and an 8-megapixel, wide-angle camera. Here’s a nifty commercial that shows it off.


This system doesn’t seem to work like Apple’s dual rear-facing cameras to create a bokeh effect. Instead, they seem to be differentiated mainly by their angle and how much of a scene they can capture.


This isn’t the first phone to feature dual selfie cameras; Lenovo’s Vibe S1 from 2015 also included dual selfie cameras. Unfortunately for people in the US, we haven’t gotten any dual selfie camera phones — the F3 and F3 Plus will only be released abroad — so we’re stuck with our boring regular photos. Maybe one day, though.
