The launch of the P20 range came as a huge surprise to many when it was announced at the Grand Palais event in Paris last week. Expected to be the next release in Huawei's P Series was the P11 - the logical step to last year's Huawei P10 and P10 Plus. Instead, three advanced smartphones took its place: enter the Huawei P20, P20 Pro and P20 Lite.


Jumping ahead of the game, the Huawei P20 collection is something truly special. In fact, two phones from the trio have been causing a major stir in the tech world after smashing the DxOMark leaderboard (the official reference point for image quality), with the Huawei P20 and P20 Pro claiming the top two positions. Officially known for having the highest rated cameras on any smartphone upon their release, it's no surprise there's so much hype around Huawei's latest handsets.


Can't wait to learn more about the Huawei P20 and P20 Pro? Or are you curious about the Huawei P20 Lite - the fantastic, budget-friendly option in the range. We've put the features of each one head-to-head, so you can decide which handset is perfect for you.


Huawei P20 Design and Display


One of the best-looking Huawei releases to date, all three P20 devices share the same sleek, stylish look. A smooth metal frame is placed between a durable glass front and back, adding a premium feel to the trio. There's a fingerprint scanner situated perfectly beneath the rear camera, while you'll notice a small notch on the front for the front-facing camera.


The major differences lie with size, weight and screen quality. The Huawei P20 features a 5.8-inch FullView HD+ display and weighs 165g, with dimensions of 149.1 x 70.8 x 7.7mm while its bigger brother the Huawei P20 Pro boasts a 6.1-inch OLED FullView HD+ display and comes in a touch heavier at 180g. It measures 155 x 73.9 x 7.8mm - slightly bigger all-round compared to P20.


As for the Huawei P20 Lite, impressively you can expect the same 5.8-inch FullView HD+ display as the P20, all while weighing less at 145g. Size-wise, it sits at 148.6 x 71.2 x 7.4mm.


Huawei P20 Camera


The feature that everyone's been talking about is the P20 cameras. We'll start with the Huawei P20 Pro - after all, DxOMark have ranked this the best smartphone camera ever.


Using Lecia technology, the triple-lens camera on the P20 Pro is powered by artificial intelligence. Ensuring you get the best shots even in low light, you'll find a huge 40MP RGB sensor, a 20MP monochrome sensor and an 8MP telephoto lens packed into the rear camera. When combined, you're guaranteed vibrant, crystal-clear shots that look astoundingly true to life. Need to get closer to the action? Use the 5X Hybrid Zoom without the fear of losing excessive detail.


The Huawei P20's rear camera isn't too far behind the P20 Pro. Ranked second by DxOMark, it offers an incredible 12MP RGB sensor and a 20MP monochrome sensor. The pair make bokeh portraits easy to snap, with AI adjusting settings automatically so you always get the perfect photo.


The same selfie camera can be found on the Huawei P20 and P20 Pro. At a whopping 24MP, you'll be pushed to find a larger resolution elsewhere. Pre-loaded professional studio lighting effects help to create photos that are so Instagram-ready, so you may not even want to go in with other [photo editing apps] afterwards.


The P20 Lite's got an impressive camera installed as well, especially for the price. The 16MP and 2MP dual-lens rear camera is brilliant in any lighting conditions, while the 16MP front-facing camera promises to always capture your good side with absolute clarity.


Huawei P20 Power


All three handsets run Android Oreo straight out of the box, so you can enjoy the latest features without having to upgrade first. High-end processors keep the devices running smoothly too, with the P20 and P20 Pro featuring an octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 670 processor while the P20 Lite has an octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 659 processor - both of which are seriously speedy.


As for RAM, there's 4GB on the Huawei P20 Lite and P20, and a massive 6GB on the advanced Huawei P20 Pro. There's tons of space for downloading games and storing photos as well, with 128GB on the P20 and P20 Pro, and 64GB of expandable storage on the P20 Lite.


Huawei P20 Battery


You should have enough juice to see you through even the busiest day, as Huawei has ensured an impressive battery life throughout the P20 family. The P20 Pro offers the largest battery, with 4000 mAh promising to deliver 25 hours of talk time, while the P20 provides 19 hours of talk time with its 3400 mAh battery. As for the P20 Lite, you're looking at a 3000 mAh battery, but with less demanding features you can expect a huge 30 hours of talk time.


Considering a device from the P20 range for your next handset? If you're all about the camera, go for either the Huawei P20 Pro or the P20. Prefer something slightly smaller, that still boasts a great specs on a reduced pricetag? Try the Huawei P20 Lite.
