How To Start a Blog – Beginner’s Guide for 2019


– Guide by Jessica Knapp (updated January 9th 2019)


So, you want to start a blog huh? Great idea!


But…how the heck do you get started? There’s so much info out there on the web, and everyone’s telling you to do different things. Who do you listen to? Where’s the starting point?


Damnit, maybe you should just forget it – it’s too confusing!


Well, hold up. I used to be a blogging newbie too. I had the same problems. I started my blog (BloggingBasics101.com) way back in 2006, and I knew less than nothing about blogging. In fact, it was only the week before I’d learned what a blog was.


Now I know a ton about them, and my blog’s doing pretty well – I receive more than 300,000 unique visitors per month which makes me consider myself someone you could listen to and learn from when it comes to building your own blog. I’m not some sort of Guru, but I certainly do know the basics.


I promise it’ll be simple, relatively easy, and definitely easy to understand (no stupid jargon). Sound good?


Awesome, let’s move on.


Why you should create a blog and join the blogging community


So below, I’m going to outline exactly what you need to do to get started and set up your own personal blog. Before we dive in though, I really want to talk about WHY you should build a blog.


Note: If you already have a solid idea of the whys, then skip this and go right ahead with the guide.

 1. Blogging has quickly become one of the most popular ways of communicating and spreading information and news. There are literally millions of blogs online (don’t worry, you can make yours stand out and get noticed!).
 2. It’s a great way to express yourself and also a fantastic way to share information with others.
 3. You become a better person and a better writer.
 4. The best reason? You can make money doing it!

I bet you already knew all of that, but it’s nice to be reminded.


One very last thing before we get started:


Creating your own blog can take a little while, probably up to 30 minutes. So grab yourself a coffee or juice (whatever you fancy) and let’s get stuck in. If you need any help during the set-up process, get in touch with me here and I’ll help as best I can and answer any questions you might have).


Disclosure: This guide to starting your own blog contains some affiliate links. If you purchase any service through one of these links I may earn a small commission, this is at no extra cost to you.


The Steps Covered In This Blogging Guide


It’s nowhere near as difficult as setting up a website from scratch (there’s very little technical ability needed here). In fact, there’s no coding required by you. Good news, huh?


How to Start a Blog in 5 Steps:


There are five main steps you need to do in order to start a blog. If you follow this guide exactly, you’ll have your own blog set up in 30 minutes or less.

 1. Choose a great blog platform
 2. Choose a web host for your blog
 3. How to Set up a blog on your own domain
 4. Design your new blog
 5. Useful resources for blogging

So, we made it. Phew. Better late than never! So, without further ado, let’s jump into step 1.


Step 1 – Choose your preferred blogging platform


Choosing where you want to build blog is pretty much the first thing you have to do. I’m going to take a leap and assume you’ve heard of WordPress, and this is the platform I advocate. It’s massive.


It’s by far one of the biggest blogging platforms in the world, with countless plugins and add-ons and almost infinite ways to design and layout your blog.


There are more than 82 million active users of WordPress = a lot, basically.


There are other alternatives, however, and they are listed below:

  * Blogger – Definitely the next best thing to WordPress.
  * Tumblr – Half social network, half blog. Interesting, and very simple to use.

Even though WordPress is bigger (and probably better) than those two, here are my reasons why you should still go with WordPress:

 1. Super easy set-up and is free to use
 2. Tons of free themes and layouts (I’m not kidding, there are gazillions).
 3. There’s a massive support forum in case you get stuck (you won’t, but it’s nice to have it there if you need it).
 4. Your blog will be insanely fast and it’ll also look Functionality and form – perfect!
 5. People can interact with you easily. Your content can be shared, commented on, and so on.

Here’s an article about different blogging platforms (including WordPress), give it a read:


How to Choose a Blogging Platform – (updated for 2019)


Now, Step 2 (see, we’re moving fast now!)


Step 2 – Self-hosting or a free alternative?


Whoa, slow down there! This is the biggest decision you’ll have to make before we go any further. You need to decide whether to pay for your blog or grab a free one.


WordPress, Tumblr, and Blogger all offer free blogs for anyone. Awesome, right? It’s perfect for those of us who aren’t super serious about blogging. But it does have downsides:


1) You won’t be able to get your OWN domain name


On a free blog, your blog’s web address (your URL) will be butt-ugly. Like, really ugly. In short, create a free blog with any other the above free blog services and it’ll look like this:

  * yourblog.wordpress.com
  * yourblog.blogspot.com
  * yourblog.tumblr.com

I know, ugly right?


2) Limits and more limits


There are some limits to free blogs. You can’t fully monetize it, and you don’t have the possibility to upload all those videos and images you want to show everyone – it’s all limited. Worse still, you won’t even have access to the free themes offered by WordPress.


3) You DON’T OWN your blog


It might sound silly at first, but you don’t actually own your blog. It’s hosted on someone else’s web property and they can delete it if they want to. They have done so in the past, and keep doing it in the future. Which means all your hard work on your blog, all those countless hours of writing blog posts might have vanished within seconds. Sad…


On the other hand, with a self-hosted blog on your own domain name – you are the REAL owner of your blog. You’ll be able to name your blog whatever you want, for example, “YourName.com” or “YourAwesomeBlog.com. You can end it with .com, .co.uk, .net, .org, or virtually any other web suffix. Add to that unlimited bandwidth for videos, images, and content plus the free themes and you have a winning combo.


So how much is hosting and a domain name? Not as much as you’re thinking, fortunately. It usually works out to about $5 to $10 per month, depending on your hosting provider which is less than a couple of coffees.


If you still have questions, here’s some further information for you to look at:

  * Should I Choose a Hosted or Non-hosted Blogging Platform?

Step 3 – Start a blog on your own domain (if you chose self-hosting and a custom domain)


I’m going to push ahead based on the premise you’ve chosen WordPress, and if you haven’t, you should. Seriously, it’s the best.


If you’re still a little confused by what a self-hosted blog is, allow me to explain and how you can go about setting one up for yourself.


You’ll need to come up with a domain name you like and also choose a hosting company that can host your blog.

  * Domain: The domain is basically the URL of your website. Examples: google.com (Google.com is the domain), Facebook.com (Facebook.com is the domain). See? Simple!
  * Hosting: Hosting is basically the company that puts your website up on the internet so everyone else can see it. Everything will be saved on there. Think of it as a computer hard-drive on the internet where your blog will be saved.

Disclosure: I recommend using Just Host for web hosting. If you click through one of my links and make a purchase, I will receive a commission, which helps me keep bloggingbasics101.com up and running.


Personally, I use Just Host (for my blog domain and hosting), and I’ve got nothing but good things to say about it.


It’s probably one of the cheapest (less than $4 per month) hosting providers out there. A domain name will cost around $10-15 a year, but with Just Host, they throw that in for free for your first year.


:). Big smiles for that!


They’re the providers I use for all of my blogs, including the one you’re reading right now.


If for any reason you don’t want to go with Just Host, feel free to choose your own hosting company. Most, if not all of them, should have a “one-click” WordPress install solution on their admin panel.


That button will automatically install WordPress on your blog. Did I say it was simple or what?


All you need to do is sign up with Just Host (or your chosen provider), choose your hosting plan and a domain name and look for the one-click WordPress install button on the admin panel.


WordPress essentials aren’t often needed, but I’d recommend whois privacy (that will keep all your personal details private) and definitely automated backups (that’ll save your website just in case anything fails or disappears so you won’t lose any or very little of your blog).

Once WordPress is installed on your website, all you have to do to start blogging is go to your WP-Admin page usually www.yourblognamehere.com/wp-admin and start writing by adding a new post.


At the start, the layout looks confusing, but it gets very understandable quickly. Don’t worry!


Step 4 – Designing your WordPress blog


Now, the fun bit.


Let’s make your blog look exactly how you want it to. To choose a new theme, you can either head to Appearance > Themes and install a free WordPress theme or you can head to a premium theme website like ThemeForest.net and buy a theme for around $40.


I usually choose something that looks professional and pretty easy to customize. WordPress also has this awesome feature that allows you to change themes with just a few clicks. So if you start getting tired of your current blog template, you can just switch to another one without losing any precious content or images.


Remember, your blog’s design should reflect both you and your personality, but also what the blog is about. There’s no point having a football-orientated theme if your blog is about tennis, understand?


On top of that, it should be easy to navigate if you want people to stick around. If it’s tricky and difficult to move around it, people won’t stay. After all design is a subjective art; meaning everyone likes different things.


But no one likes ugly websites, and they especially hate websites that need a university degree to navigate. Make it easy for them.


For more reading, I’ve put together 3 blog posts about designing your blog. Feel free to check them through.

  * Blog Design: Keep It Clutter Free and User-Friendly
  * Advice for Blog Design and Blog Goals
  * Is there any software I can use to make my own graphics, button, and banner?

Last step! Woo!


Step 5 – Useful Resources For Beginner Bloggers


Bloggers come to blogging arena with varying degrees of online and social media experience, but we’ve all made more than a few newbie mistakes – there’s always room for more learning and improvement, whether you’re a beginner or you’ve been blogging for years.


These articles may help you avoid some of the growing pains when it comes to your first blog – enjoy!:

  * 5 Beginning Blogging Mistakes You Can Fix
  * Choosing a Blogging Niche
  * How We Communicate: FAQs for Beginning Bloggers
  * 7 Ways to Boost your success as a Blogger

And that’s it! I’m more than confident that your initial blog set up should now be finished and ready to go, and all that should have been really damn easy (unlike my first time, lucky you!). If you are having any problems installing WordPress on Just Host then this guide may help.

        The best thing I ever did to get traffic was to promote my early blog posts on social media (Twitter/Facebook) and forums I was a member of… Once your blog has been around a few months you will start to see some trickles of traffic from search engines.

    This is very useful information for me as a beginner blogger. I figured to try blogging as a project while working on my MBA program online this year. I haven’t finished publishing my blog site yet. Still checking out some tips and advice prior to publishing. A bit nervous but after reading other new bloggers helps build my confidence. Hopefully I get the nerves to publish by end of January. As you mentioned, I ended up using WordPress.

    Hi, so I’ve been thinking about writing a book about my personal experience with adultery and how this was the worst mistake I’ve ever made and I have made many. In June 2008 my now ex wife became pregenant with our second child but the previous month she introduced me to Facebook. That was the beginning of the end. To make a long story short my ex wife and a woman I met on Facebook both gave birth to my 2 daughters 51 days apart. The blog I want to start will hopefully help other men not be as self destructive as myself.

    Hello Jessica


    I am a real newbie, 72 years old, I though your info was great,and will take all your teaching in, are you allowed to copy and paste stuff
    you see on the subject you interested in ?

        No, copy pasting will help you in no way. Avoid copy pasting at all costs because it seems like it is your content when all you do is copy paste, and if you want to refer to some other blog post, copy paste the content and give them proper credit by adding their blog post link in the end. ðŸ™‚ Good luck!

    It was interesting to see the diagram wheel picture in tip one with all the different domains that are used. Self-hosted WordPress seems to be the most popular. Do you think it has to do with how you can customize it the way you want the most compared to the other domains? I’m wanting to start my blog of dancing. I sincerely appreciate all of these additional ideas to get my blog started!

        I think the WordPress is phenomenal for 3 reasons:


        1) Quick and fast support board
        2) Easily customizable
        3) Very user-friendly

    I’ve a blog on weebly.com and now I want it to transfer in WordPress, because it is more SEO friendly than weebly. Is it possible to transfer or do you’ve any particular suggestion on this?

    Hello Jessica,


    Thank you for the info on blogging. I would like to apply it to my website and have a question.


    When I try to install WordPress, I am told that my files will be overwritten. What exactly does this mean? Will WordPress code simply be inserted into my code (html), leaving the code otherwise intact so that my pages will be displayed as before (but now with blogging capability)? Or is there more to it?


    Thanks.

        Hi Gene,


        By default – it has “index.html” placed in your root domain folder. If you overwrite it – it’ll disappear and be replaced with the WordPress index file. So basically, you just need to overwrite it.

    Hi. Thank you for your informative post. I’m still looking for the best (least expensive or free) value to use my own domain (not with wordpress.com or the like in the domain name). If you’ve included this information somewhere, I have missed it. I also didn’t see it on the comparison chart? I’m sure it’s probably there, but maybe worded differently…?
    Thank you again.

        Hi Gretchen


        You can use your own domain name on a platform such as Tumblr for free but as you are on their platform you will be restricted to the types of content you can produce, the types of advertisements you can host and it is difficult to move to a self hosted WordPress environment later down the line.


        In this guide I recommend Just Host hosting for beginner bloggers as it only costs a a few dollars per month and gives you more control over your blog, how you can make money and it’s future.

    Hi, thanks for this very helpful post! Is it possible to register a domain even if you don’t plan on using it immediately? Basically just ensuring that you get the domain name that you want (if possible). Also, if I’m planning to blog on varying topics what would you recommend to do as far as a name? Do you think it’s imperative that the name coincides with the topic? I only ask because I’ve seen fashion/beauty blogs where their names have nothing to do with fashion or beauty. I’m sooo stuck on the name I can’t move to the next steps! Ugh!

    Reply
      + Jessica Knapp October 9, 2015 / 5:22 pm

        You can use Godaddy, Namecheap and several other registrars for this, it definitely helps if the domain name is related to the niche but it’s not imperative.

49. Dwayne October 22, 2015 / 1:11 am

    Really excellent article. One suggestion or caution with Godaddy though…Godaddy has a product called WordPress Hosting. I signed up for it, and all was fine until I installed a plugin which had a special requirement that needed to be set up by the webhost. (something in the server side settings). I called Godaddy and they advised they can’t make those changes. Only on their individual hosting plans would that have been possible. This is a rare event, but worth keeping in mind. When you go for your own hosting you have more flexibility.

      + Ken October 29, 2016 / 7:47 pm

        This sounds a bit similar to my experience, however with a better ending. I accidentally signed up for their WordPress account only to discover I couldn’t do really anything else with the account. I wanted the full (cPanel) version. I called them up and they very graciously switched me at no charge. And, I can still do WordPress on my account.

    WordPress is the best option for anyone thinking about starting a blog. You need a self hosted WordPress to start a good blog. It will give you a strong base to do anything with your blog.
    So anyone wanna start a new blog… forget about blogspot, tumblr etc just go with self hosted wordpress


    It will cost you some money but not very much. Nowdays shared hosting is very cheap and I guess anyone can afford $5 per month.

        I started out with just a blog post and an about me page. It is entirely up to you but it can often be a good idea to have a few posts when you start your blog so people can learn more about you and the topics you are covering. There is no right and wrong answer ðŸ™‚


        The main thing is to start, that is the hardest step – don’t be nervous – practise makes perfect your first posts probably won’t be your greatest but only by regularly writing and promoting your blog will you grow your audience and become a better blogger.

        1. You can keep the money however you’ll be restricted to the types of products you can promote as WordPress.com are particular about the ad networks and affiliate offers open to you.


        2. You can migrate to a self hosted blog later on but if you don’t have your own custom domain name then you’ll lose the traffic you have built up. A domain name is going to cost you $15 from WordPress.com whilst a domain name + 1 years hosting at Just Host is around $27 for the sake of around $12 I think it makes sense to start off totally in control.

I was paying about 29.00 dollars a year for many years, but all of a sudden it jumped to about 150.00 a year. I tried contacting WordPress about this unexplained huge increase, but they chose not to respond.

        Hi Larson


        WordPress is free open source software – you are referring to your web hosting company. Web hosts will inform you of any charges in advance and it is very easy to move to a new host. Some web hosts offer free transfers if you sign up for a contract of 12 months or more. The other thing to do to avoid sudden price hikes is pay for 36 months rather than 12.

    I always encourage my friends to look at WPengine for hosting, its a bit more pricey but is really stable and reliable, plus they include tons of goodies that are usually considered a premium service and they all work without a struggle. Thinks like a CDN, Backups, Offload to S3. All these things can really help the quality and consistency of your site and are definitely something to think about whether you are a beginner or an advanced blogger.

        WP Engine is a superb prospect however you’re looking at $29p/m for their most basic package. This is way out of the reach of most of my readers. This article is aimed at people who are just taking their first baby steps into blogging, and aren’t yet at a level of knowledge or income to justify something that costs over $300 per year. In comparison the hosting I recommend costs around $72 for 3 years and includes a free domain name in year one.

    Will it be possible to set up a blog where comments cannot be posted and emails cannot be sent to me? My only interest in blogging at this time is for a limited number of friends and family. I don’t want to deal with comments and such from random visitors.

    Hi Jessica!
    first of all thank you, you’ve made it so clear!
    I’ve got one question though:
    what if I already have a web domain (I bought it from WordPress)
    plus I already have a portfolio/blog site on WordPress for School purpose,(which I didn’t pay for by the way)
    as I’m a Multimedia Designer.
    is it Possible to open ANOTHER blog with my domain on WordPress as you recommended?
    I’d love to have a another one apart from school and I Was wondering if that would be possible
    without paying again, even though I’d like to have the full control on it.
    Thanks in advance and have a nice day! ðŸ™‚

        Hi Paz


        You can transfer the domain away from WordPress.com to a domain registrar such as Namecheap or Godaddy. This might cost you around $9-12.


        Once this is done you will be free to host your blog anywhere.

    I have to agree with you and also put some emphasis on uniqueness. The most successful blogs today are definitely those that have an individual personal twist. People love new content and the more unique the likelihood that it will be shared more and draw in more people.

        Absolutely agree with you Gary. Be Unique, be yourself – I often find it easier when I sit down to blog to think about writing for one person.


        Sometimes that can be a reader who has sent me a question, other times I might think of a friend or family member who needs some help.

The only thing that get me from stale mate point is that I’ve performed some serious keyword expansion. I’ve got help from support guys from the SEO tool I’ve been using. Now I know how to rank well for as many relevant keywords as possible and it did miracles to by blog. The tool calls SERPstat and the guy were awesome. Thanks for this post.

    Great article, yes I do agree that WordPress.org (self-hosted) is the best methods to start a blog and website these days. It has darn near become industry standard. Heck, you have major corporations transferring their sites over to WordPress. The reputation, flexibility, capability, tools and ease-of-use that it offers makes it a winner!

    Great article about blogging. This is very helpful. I have been blogging about fashion for my Apparel Search website for many years, but have not received much traction for the efforts. Hopefully your suggestions will be of help. Even though I post often and I think with helpful information for people interesting in clothing, I don’t seem to gain any followers. After several years, I have people reading the blogs, but no followers and not many people posting comments. Rather frustrating, but I will continue my efforts. Anyway, thank you for your post and hopefully it helps me and others improve our blogging.

    Great post, blogging is hard. We run a travel blog and I think the most important thing we tell people is to travel with a purpose, Do not just wander around the world aimlessly. (Like ours is to experience and document the Top 100 Travel Adventures) So many travel blogs do not really have a purpose or a niche. Niche is key and many miss out on that because they want to cover and do it all. Do not just start a blog because you think you will get rich quick and be able to travel the world. It takes a lot of work and lots of time.

    I am a newbie, which explains why I am here. Do you think it is a good idea to start with a blogger host using the free domain they offer before purchasing a domain of your own to ensure you have what it takes to gain a decent following and that you are up for the task of maintaining a good blog?

        No – you need your own domain. Moving blogs later will be very hard to do.

    Thanks so much for this article and all of the links! I’ve been thinking about blogging for the past year. This year I started my Instagram page and just this week joined Twitter and Facebook as a means of (hopefully) expanding once the blog is underway. My first dilemma however, is the name! For the past four months, I have been @travelsandtantrums on IG (and the other platforms) however, I am thinking of changing that name as it began as a way of documenting our big family trip this year – I hadn’t counted on growth (as you talk about in your articles). Also, as our kids grow up, I hope that the ‘tantrums’ will subside – so, I don’t know whether to stick with what I have or to change to a more ‘family/reality’ name. It is catchy but is it relevant if we are not ‘travelling’ all the time? Hmmmmm. I’d love to know what you think!

        Hi Venny,


        The most important thing is choosing a name you’re going to be happy with for the next 3 years at least.


        Blogs always evolve over time some of my first blogs didn’t really stick to a small set of topics after a while but it’s better to show expertise and experience in one area to begin with.

    Hi Jessica,


    Nice beginner-friendly guide. I would add a quick tip for those who are starting their blogs.


    Many bloggers spend a lot of time looking for “the best” theme and later invest even more time in its customisation. Sure, there is nothing bad about having a nice design. But…


    As the majority of them are not full time bloggers, every hour more spent on the designing of the blog means one hour less for creating the content. And, using the chess terminology, if the content is king (and quality backlinks queen), the blog design is only bishop.


    I always recommend to the newbies start to publish their articles as soon as possible and not spend more than 20% of the time with other tasks. Why?


    Because even an ugly blog with great content can be successful. But nice blog without good content will never attract new visitors.
