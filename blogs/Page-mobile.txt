Oppo makes devices which always have selfies as the main selling point with this device the brand tried to get into an overall packed device but still, there is nothing new in this smartphone which makes it stands out from the rest. The smartphone comes with good battery life, slim profile, a decent overall performance which you can get on other smartphones too. it is worth noting that there is no fingerprint sensor in it.

  * Decent overall performance
  * Good battery life
  * Slim and light
The Bad

  * Slightly rough around the edges

Oppo A83 is a budget smartphone which comes with a decent overall performance. The smartphone in terms of design looks decent and so does the display. The strongest point of this device has to be the battery life. it can last you an entire day if you're a moderate user like me. There is no fingerprint sensor which is like a standard in a smartphone these days. The cameras, on the other hand, are just average. nothing new with them.
The Good
  * Decent overall performance

Oppo A83 is another budget smartphone from the brand. It runs on their custom UI which is somewhat optimized in this device. The smartphone has average cameras which are acceptable at this price. In terms of performance, you can expect some pretty good results. I tend to watch a lot of movies on my smartphone and so far I am loving the display. The device is perfect for those who consume lots of media.
The Good
  * Great display
  * Good build quality
  * Decent performance
The Bad
  * Average cameras
