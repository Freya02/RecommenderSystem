* Will the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 be virtually indistinguishable design-wise from the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, pictured here? — AFP Relaxnews

What is "understood to be an official render of the Galaxy Note 9" has made its way to tech blog Android Headlines from what the site claims is a "reliable source". The rather basic image seems to confirm speculations of there being little to no design changes between the upcoming device and its predecessor.

When Samsung introduced the Galaxy S9 back in February at Mobile World Congress, there was some surprise at how similar the front of the flagship looked to that of its predecessor, the Galaxy S8. And now, as the Aug 9 launch of the Galaxy Note 9 approaches, new leaks reveal that history may be repeating itself with a familiar-looking new model.
