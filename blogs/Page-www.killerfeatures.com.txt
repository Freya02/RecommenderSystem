Xiaomi has finally pulled the wraps from the much awaited Poco F1. The device has made a cameo in many rumor pieces and we finally get to see the Poco F1 in flesh. Xiaomi has aced the art of pricing their devices in the best price segment and this time around they seem to have notched up their game. Xiaomi has announced its 'Poco' lineup, a premium spin-off that offers the best features while maintaining the affordability quotient. Let us dive right in and take a look at all the super cool features the Poco F1 has to offer:


1.Flagship SoC at Mid-Range Price


Xiaomi has upped their game and is offering Snapdragon 845 in a device that is priced starting at Rs 20,999. The Poco F1 comes powered by a Snapdragon 845 paired with up to 8GB of RAM. Xiaomi touts the Poco F1 has consistently ranked high on AnTuTu benchmark and offers the best performance. Xiaomi claims that they have cut down on other unnecessary features and focused on offering the best performance.


2.Chic Display and Tuck-able Notch


Despite sticking to a strict budget, Xiaomi does manage to surprise us with the 6.18-inch FHD edge to edge display with Corning Gorilla Glass protection. The display offers up to 500 nits of brightness and a relatively high contrast ratio of 1500:1. That being said the notch marks its presence on the Poco F1, however the Poco F1


3.LiquidCool Technology


All the computing grunt is of no use if the device doesn't manage the heat that it generates. In other words, the Poco F1 employs LiquidCool Technology in which a liquid is circulated along the chassis to absorb heat and eventually offer better thermal management solutions. We have already seen this on other phones like the Nokia Lumia 950 and the Honor Note 10.


4.Giant Battery


Poco F1 is backed by a 4000mAh battery and supports Quick Charge 3.0. What is more, the smartphone covers all your charging needs with a 9V 2A charger out of the box. Summing it up, the large battery and the flagship SoC should ideally boost both performance and efficiency.


5.Brand new App Drawer


The Foco F1 gets an MIUI but with a few twists. The MIUI on the Foco F1 heralds with a POCO Launcher, Turbocharged engine and a fast updates promise. Additionally, the MIUI has been optimized to offer a fast and seamless experience in the Poco F1. Moving on, the Poco App Drawer offers speedier app search and groups apps automatically. It also offers better privacy features and the beta will be launched on the Google Play store on the 29th of August.


The Turbocharged Engine offers faster app startup, foreground app loading and faster-swiping experience. Apart from the deep optimization the Poco F1 also offers open kernel source code.


6. Introducing 4G+


The Poco F1 offers 4G+ technology which essentially combines different spectrum and helps in achieving better network performance and better coverage in indoors. Poco India claims that the 4G+ will result in 275 percent faster data throughput as opposed to the traditional 4G.


7.The IR Face Unlock


Keeping up with the trends the Poco F1 comes baked in with an IR Face Unlock. The most evident advantage of an IR Face Unlock, as opposed to the regular ones, is that the latter works even when it is dark.


8.Dirac Audio treatment


In order to cater for the audiophiles, the Poco F1 comes with a Dirac HD Sound and a dual smart PA that offers lour and clear audio. Xiaomi claims that the dual audio output from the bottom speakers and the earpiece offers a stereo like experience.


9.AI Flavoured Camera


The Poco F1 features a dual rear camera setup with 12MP Sony IMX363 sensor and a 5MP Samsung Sensor. The 12MP sensor offers an impressive 1.4um pixels. This translates to more light per pixel and thus well-lit photographs. Other AI related features include backlit detection, real-time AI photography, and a scene detection mode that supports 206 scenes. Selfie/front camera is a 20MP sensor.
