Huawei P20 Lite Forums are now open


The Huawei P20 Lite was announced just a couple of weeks ago alongside the P20 and P20 Pro. As the name implies, the Lite model is on the lower-end of the bunch. It still has a nice 5.8-inch display with 2280×1080 resolution, dual 16+2MP cameras, 4GB of RAM, and Android 8.0 Oreo. The less impressive specs include the Kirin 659 processor and smaller 3,000 mAh battery. Forums are now open for this device.


The XDA Forum for the P20 Lite is open and ready for users and potential buyers to hop in. There are already a number of active threads in the forum. This is an affordable device and there has been a lot of excitement about the P20 series. There should be quite a few users joining the forum in the coming weeks. Hit the link below to join the conversation.
