                                      The phone ordered through amazon came with the phone, wall port for charger, charging cord, headphones, replaceable ear buds and a cheap plastic case. This is just for those who had concerns on what came in the box.

                                      5.0 out of 5 starsCompared to my LG G6 my brother and my mom have the note 8 and they are really impressed by how myth phone looks videos are super! Games play is so nice

                                      This phone is very fast. Compared to my LG G6 my brother and my mom have the note 8 and they are really impressed by how myth phone looks videos are super! Games play is so nice! I get so many compliments on my phone. Picture quality is better than the I phone x. ( which is what my wife has) the edge sense is not complicated nor glitchy? You know what's nice when I'm texting and I can shrink the screen smaller so I don't have to stretch my thumb. If any one is thinking about buying this phone I promise you won't be disappointed. It was hard to just spend the money but when you look at YouTube videos that are not biased on Samsung phones you'll see that they are impressively fast .

                                      5.0 out of 5 starsThis phone is TOTALLY worth the expense
                                      July 19, 2018
                                      Verified Purchase
                                      Had the phone for a week, and I can safely assure that the U12+ is a killer smartphone, definitely worth the purchase:
                                      
                                      - "Buttons" are JUST FINE guys! Feels like the overblown reviews on them are just that (or HTC updated them); either way, buttons and HTC Sense work perfectly fine :-)
                                      - Software has no lag whatsoever
                                      - The build quality, beside beautiful, is TREMENDOUS and tough - I have rocked this (and dropped) without a case, and still no scratches
                                      
                                      If you can shell out for this phone, do it. No regrets on my end. :-)

                                      This phone is simply beautiful, smooth and takes good pictures. Functions well as a phone with good phone calls. The buttons... it's not as bad as what reviewers said, but admittedly I would prefer normal buttons. That being said, it's not a deal breaker in this case. Recommended!

                                      4.0 out of 5 starsGreat upgrade
                                      July 2, 2018
                                      Verified Purchase
                                      I just upgraded to the U12+ from an HTC One M8 and love the phone. I deducted 1 star because I'm still undecided on the whole lack of physical buttons. I've had it less than a week and getting more accustomed to the whole HTC Edge Sense and how it reacts. Once I'm used to Sense and the digital buttons, maybe I'll give it 5 stars.
                                      
                                      The phone is lightning fast compared to my old phone, charges faster, battery lasts longer, takes fantastic pictures, etc. I've been using HTC phones since the EVO and hope they keep making phones as I'm not a fan of Samsung.

                                      The BUTTONS, why htc, you could of done so much better, these pressure sense 2 buttons ruin any chance of a case working well. First it wants to feel you holding the phone in portrait, and until you squeeze the phone and the volume button at the same time it will not change the volume.
                                      
                                      The should come up with a better way to control volume, with a case it will be impossible half of the time leaving you in akward situation where you blast someone's eardrums out cause the music plays at level 100.
                                      
                                      The only good part is the camera and speakers. The phone is thick, and that's good. Phones need to be body positive, why do we even like thin tiny battery phones. The battery like is, eh, ok. The u11 had amazing battery and I was hopping this would carry over but it just has an average battery life. The screens not that bright. The selfie camera is trash 50% of the time, either failing to capture a sharp image, or perfecting bolkeh. It's simply a bland phone, in a case. Whip it out of your protective case and gamble your 800 phone, and you will be amazed by the slim nice weight with transparent glass and unique buttons.
