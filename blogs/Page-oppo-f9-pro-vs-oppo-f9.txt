Oppo F9 Pro vs Oppo F9: What’s Different in Specs, Camera, Size

September 8, 2018

Recently, Oppo unveiled two new mid-range smartphones with water drop design rather than a notch concept. Apart from bringing in the new display concept, these smartphones are known to be the first in series to get the Gorilla Glass 6 protection. Just a few weeks back, it even introduced Oppo Find X with its true bezel-less display and pop-up camera module concept. It seems like the Chinese company is going ahead of the competition with its innovative concept designs. Though the notch on the Oppo F9 and Oppo F9 Pro seems to be inspired by the Essential phone, still it has its own identity. Furthermore, Vivo is even in plans to launch a smartphone with the similar waterdrop display. Another major highlight of the latest Oppo smartphones is Super fast VOOC charging support. Let us explore further to understand the main difference between Oppo F9 and Oppo F9 Pro.


Oppo F9 Pro vs Oppo F9: Design & Display


There is no much difference in terms of design in both the handsets. They feature the same 6.3-inches full HD plus display screen of 19:9 aspect ratio, 1080 X 2340 screen resolution, and 409PPI pixel density. They have the unique design with water drop notch along with 90.8 percent screen to body ratio. Moreover, the duo handsets get the glass finish that is claimed to survive 15 water drops from 1-meter height. It is further available in attractive color shades including Sunrise Red, Twilight Blue, and Starry Purple.
