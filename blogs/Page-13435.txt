    No 7.1 Plus with Snapdragon 710? I'm disappointed. I'm probably going to wait for 7nm SoC's anyways though in the 7xx range. Reply

    * Teckk - Thursday, October 04, 2018 - link

      Exactly, I was waiting for a Nokia 7.X with either a 710 or 730. I don't want to spend beyond this on a phone, might have to wait for a while then :(
      I hope they don't pull off the new 8.1 with 710. 8.1 is mostly 845/some Qualcomm flagship SOC? Reply

      * Meteor2 - Friday, October 05, 2018 - link

        There's always something better coming next... You could wait forever Reply

         * Teckk - Friday, October 05, 2018 - link

           True, but I keep my phone for at least 3 years. So I don't mind waiting a couple of months more to get a better phone as long as my current phone is not close enough to being unusable. I do agree with you though, new phones launch every now and then it would have been easier of I was ignorant of SoCs ðŸ˜Š Reply

           * niva - Friday, October 05, 2018 - link

             Same here, my Nexus 6 is about to die though, I'm surprised it lasted this long and is still working, but it's just a matter of time now. I too am disappointed with Nokia on this phone, was expecting a clean device without notches, and thought the SD 710 would be it for the 7 series phones... apparently not.
             
             Still, this is a good device and in the absence of something better I might jump on it when my phone dies. I'm now really interested to see what the Pixel 3 will bring and price/availability of those devices. The one thing really holding me back from the Pixel 2/3 is the lack of headphone jack which the Nokia seems to have...
             
             There has to be a sacrifice with every decide out there. How hard is it for someone to make a device without compromises? Reply

  * Mr Perfect - Thursday, October 04, 2018 - link

    I was really hoping that HMD would skip the screen notch trend, seeing as how the 6.1 and 7 Plus where both normal.
    
    Any word on the unlocking of bootloaders? Supposedly they're starting to make moves there, with the 8 officially supporting it now. https://www.xda-developers.com/nokia-8-bootloader-... Reply

    * haukionkannel - Thursday, October 04, 2018 - link

      Most likely when phone in near the end of its official support time. Nokia 8 was release 14th october 2017, so one year ago. Maybe other phones wuÃ¥ill get it around one to two years from the release. Reply

  * WatcherCK - Thursday, October 04, 2018 - link

    Pixel 3$$ is going to be out of my price range so this is actually looking like a pretty good replacement for my Nexus 6p esp with some included earbuds (although sennheiser momentum earbuds are due out soon too.....ðŸ¤”)
    
    Also is it wrong to think 'Florian' would make a great Bond villain name? (no offence meant to any Florians out there ðŸ˜€) Reply

  * fist003 - Tuesday, October 09, 2018 - link

    damn that notch is annoying. not gonna buy any phones with notches Reply

  * bug77 - Tuesday, October 09, 2018 - link

    7.1 is more than decent. Still, the decision to go with a glass back for 2018 models is terrible. Making that 2.5D glass means there's no way you can drop the phone without some glass shattering. So those "exquisite" looks are all for show, these phones will forever live in a protective case. Aluminium cases like they used in their 2017 models is where it's at. Reply
