How good is Honor 9 Lite Camera?



Honor has been launching smartphones with dual camera setup lately in the Indian market. The Huawei’s online brand recently launched Honor 9 Lite with dual camera setup on both front and back. This well-put-together phone holds the second place after Honor 9i to come equipped with “Quad-Camera” setup. Before talking about the USP, let’s reiterate the specs once.


The Honor 9 Lite is packed with 5.65-inch full HD+ full-screen display with 18:9 aspect ratio, is powered by Kirin 659 SoC and shipped with Android 8.0 (Oreo) with EMIUI 8.0 out-of-the-box. Apart from the gorgeous built, another USP worth mentioning about this device is its optics. In terms of specifications, the Honor 9 Lite comes with a 13-megapixel front and rear cameras along with a secondary 2-megapixel rear camera to capture depth information.


The Honor 9 Lite has clean and easy UI, that is relatively simple to adapt even for the first-timers. When you tap on the camera app, it takes you to the main screen with a bunch of toggles and features on both top and bottom. To be specific, the top bar consists of toggle for flash, wide aperture mode, portrait mode, moving picture mode and camera option, while the bottom bar houses mini-gallery, shutter button, and video mode.


Honor smartphones are features rich especially on the optics front, and the 9 Lite is no different. Users can experiment with various by swiping to the right side. If you are a photography enthusiast, one would love to interact with device considering its features.


With this device, you get to play with Pro photo, Pro Video, HDR, Time Lapse, Night shot, Good Food, Panorama, Light paint, Filter and more. You also get beautify mode that removes any blemishes and marks on your skin to provide a perfect selfie. The front camera also offers the same amount of features except for the Night shot and Light painting.


The dual cameras on both sides work in-sync to provide a picture in portrait mode, where the 13MP sensor helps to captures the detail whereas the 2MP sensor calculates and process the depth effect.


Talking about the real world usage, the Honor 9 Lite offers good quality images under daylight condition with fine details and true to nature tone. It’s worth mentioning that Bokeh mode implementation has been done up to the mark where you can change the focus afterward and adjust the blur of the background in the gallery app. The autofocus is quick to lock, the macro shots were good as well.


During the low light condition, the dual tone LED flash comes handy, without overpowering the subject even in closeup shots. It also has a feature called “Night Shot”, which helps the users to capture the subject in poor lighting with an adjustable exposure of up to 32 seconds in the mode. However, this particular mode needs a steady hand or a tripod since the phone needs to be steady. The front camera is equally good and does a very good job under daylight and indoor conditions. Users can adjust the beauty mode according to their preference. The Honor 9 Lite indeed produces some social media worthy shots for sure.
