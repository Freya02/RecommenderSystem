Meet the New Moto E⁴ & Moto E⁴ Plus: Get More of a Good Thing

No Comments

There’s no shortage of value-tier smartphones in today’s market. Many options include the common, expected features, and quality among these devices can differ. This often means you are left with few options that meet your standards and needs.


Enter the new Moto E⁴ and Moto E⁴ Plus. With a sharp look and major upgrades, they deliver the things you want – all day battery, outstanding display and advanced camera capabilities – at the price you want it for.


Moto E⁴: Sharp Display, Even Sharper Look
Moto E⁴ features a brilliant 5” HD display and elegant design. Quickly update your status and stream videos with ease, all powered by the quad-core processor and 4G speed¹ of Moto E⁴.


Moto E⁴ also has an 8MP autofocus camera, so you never have to miss another perfect photo opportunity. Plus, you’ll be able to take selfies worth sharing, even in low light conditions, with the 5MP front camera.


And with the 2800 mAh battery* of Moto E⁴ you won’t have to worry about recharging when you’re out and about, since you can keep going for hours on a single charge.


Moto E⁴ Plus: Massive Battery with a Major Upgrade
For even more of a good thing, like HD display and a huge battery, take a look at Moto E⁴ Plus. Once you pick up Moto E⁴ Plus, outfitted with a vibrant, 5.5” HD display wrapped in smooth metal, it will be hard to put it down. With a 5000 mAh battery, you can go longer without worrying about recharging**. But when it is time for a boost, there’s no need to slow down to power up, as Moto E⁴ Plus works with the 10W rapid charger, which gives you hours of battery life in minutes of charging.


Get to the good stuff faster by using your fingerprint reader to unlock your phone. Once you’re in, you’ll find you never have to miss another moment, because Moto E⁴ Plus features a 13MP autofocus rear camera and a 5MP front camera with a selfie flash for beautifully sharp photos – even in low light.


Packed with a quad-core processor and 4G speed***, Moto E⁴ Plus offers the power you need to scroll through your favorite websites, play games and more – all without the wait. And with Android™ 7.1, an updated version of the world’s most popular operating system, you can expect the best with Moto E⁴ Plus.


Availability and Pricing
Moto E⁴ and Moto E⁴ Plus will be available in a variety of sophisticated metal finishes beginning this month across various countries. Moto E⁴ will be available for $129.99 USD and €149. Moto E⁴ will also be available as an Amazon Prime Exclusive Phone; pricing details will be shared at a later date. Moto E⁴ Plus will start at $179.99 USD and €199.
