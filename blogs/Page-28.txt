Connecting us to loved ones, sharing news of the day, capturing memories — mobile phones have been our trusty companions for years. These days, they’ve become smarter and even more personalized, marrying superior performance with AI to learn more about our individual preferences to deliver compelling new experiences.


Unveiled at Mobile World Congress 2018, the ASUS ZenFone 5 series is the first of its kind to harness the power of AI. Its flagship, the ZenFone 5Z, sports an all-screen display and is powered by the Snapdragon 845 Mobile Platform, providing premium features such as on-device AI, a powerful dual-camera system, and pure speed – up to 1.2 Gbps with Gigabit LTE – all designed to change how you capture photos and share your experiences of the world around you.


Inside the ZenFone Series: ZenFone 5Z


Energized by Snapdragon 845, the ZenFone 5Z puts the power of its AI Engine in your pocket, enabling you with awesome features that can improve your camera experience, especially how you snap photos. For example, real-time, on-device AI processing lets you perform enhanced AI image recognition and scene detection without the need to access the cloud. So, you don’t just have a camera, you have a “smart” camera whose AI recognizes up to 16 different types of objects and scenes, ranging from food to sunsets to snow, automatically applying the best photo settings to ensure you get your best possible picture. These features are powered by an AI Engine found in the Snapdragon 845, harnessing the power of key hardware cores that are optimized for AI.


But your smart camera doesn’t stop there. It also learns your photography style by examining all the photos you’ve taken. When you choose your preference style for a photo, the ZenFone then applies these affects to your camera’s settings in future photos.


Another exciting feature AI brings you is the ability to take professional-looking shots with that trendy, blurry, bokeh effect – in real time! This makes your main subject look razor-sharp while subtly blurring the background, giving you a beautiful artistic effect to share.


The ZenFone 5Z’s camera is actually a dual-camera system that captures high-quality, lifelike photos – even in poor lighting – because its main camera captures five times more light than a typical smartphone’s camera. And with its second camera, you can produce dynamic 120-degree wide-angle photos, which is twice as wide as a standard smartphone camera.


And the ZenFone 5Z is as good looking on the outside as it is feature-packed on the inside: The 6.2-inch smartphone has a 90 percent screen-to-body all-screen ratio packed in a 5.5-inch body so you get more beautiful display per inch.


As for connectivity, the ZenFone 5Z integrates the Snapdragon X20 LTE Modem, which is 20 percent faster than its predecessor and is designed to deliver “fiber optic speeds wirelessly.” What does this mean for you? Peak rates of 1.2 Gbps and high throughput speeds so you can get virtually instantaneous access to your content — even in crowded networks.


ZenFone 5


Powered by the Snapdragon 636 Mobile Platform, the ZenFone 5 offers many of the same features as the ZenFone 5Z, including AI Boost Mode. This grants you an instant blast of extra power when you need it most, supporting your games and other demanding tasks. In addition to offering on-device and cloud-based AI, the platform has shown an overall 40 percent increase in performance compared to its predecessor, the Snapdragon 630 Mobile Platform. In turn, this device provides users with responsive performance, low power consumption, and an intelligent dual-camera system that adapts and learns to your photography preferences.


ZenFone 5 Lite


The ZenFone 5 Lite is a stylish, 6-inch smartphone, engineered with the Snapdragon 630 platform which is designed to support incredible performance, optimized power efficiency, advanced security, and a four-camera system. This pocket-friendly device enables quality, on-the-go mobile experiences.


By combining AI with striking photography, the ASUS ZenFone 5Z and ZenFone 5 are built to capture your world beautifully and intelligently.


The ASUS ZenFone 5 series is anticipated to be available beginning in March with the release of the ZenFone 5 Lite, followed by the ZenFone 5 in April, concluding with the launch of the ZenFone 5Z in June.


In the meantime, learn more about the advantages of integrating AI into smart devices.
