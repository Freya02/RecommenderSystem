  * Action steps for excellence

    Posted by Micah Nellums on 12/9/2018

    Students will be receiving progress reports on Tuesday 12/11. This leaves students a week (12/20) to submit any overdue assignments for cycle 3 report cards.


    As the cycle comes to a close, it is important for students to keep in mind what steps work for them and don’t in order for us to be responsible and accountable for our academic growth and success.


    Here are a few ideas to help students stay on track as we end the year and move into a new one:


      + “Actions” Ideas:

          o Attend Tutorials frequently and before assessments
          o Complete all HW everyday
          o Have all materials ready to begin class on time
          o Complete all classwork on time
          o Pay attention and actively listen
          o Ask questions in class to seek clarification
          o Actively engage in the lesson
          o Follow written and oral directions
          o Copy all information and show all work as directed
          o Seek accuracy on all assignments
          o Seek help from peers, parents, friends,teacher
          o Maintain an organized binder/notebook with all materials, assignments, resources, notes, etc.
          o Accurately copy all assignments and check assignment book/planner each night
          o Make-up all work on time
          o Use all classroom resources.
          o Prepare for and participate in “Retake Quiz” and "Retest"
          o Check PSConnect (Gradespeed) actively and respectfully approach instructors when inquiring about grades.

I am a graduate of West Virginia University. After a career in college student housing, I entered the teaching profession 13 years ago. Surprisingly, Science was not my favorite class growing up. Now, I LOVE Science! I really enjoy seeing students grow and explore their curiosities! When school is not in session, I spend my time READING, watching/playing sports, and spending as much time as possible traveling the country visiting our family and friends!

I earned my B.S. degree in Mathematics at Louisiana State University in 2010. I then went on to earn my M.S. degree in Mathematics at the University of Houston. I worked at for a seismic data company for 2 years as a processing geophysicist. I enjoyed my work but it was nothing compared to the joys of teaching I experienced as a teaching assistant at the University of Houston while earning my Master's degree. I chose to earn my Alternative Certification in Math 7-12 and since then I have been teaching!

I am a born and raised Houstonian. I attended and graduated from HISD Schools (Poe Elementary, Johnston (Meyerland) Middle School and Lamar High School). I later attended UT Arlington where I graduated with a Linguistics major, a minor in Korean and a TESOL certification. On the weekends I enjoy trying new foods, watching scary movies and hanging out with friends and family.
