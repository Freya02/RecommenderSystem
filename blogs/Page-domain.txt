  * Action steps for excellence

    Posted by Micah Nellums on 12/9/2018

    Students will be receiving progress reports on Tuesday 12/11. This leaves students a week (12/20) to submit any overdue assignments for cycle 3 report cards.


    As the cycle comes to a close, it is important for students to keep in mind what steps work for them and donât in order for us to be responsible and accountable for our academic growth and success.


    Here are a few ideas to help students stay on track as we end the year and move into a new one:


      + âActionsâ Ideas:

          o Attend Tutorials frequently and before assessments
          o Complete all HW everyday
          o Have all materials ready to begin class on time
          o Complete all classwork on time
          o Pay attention and actively listen
          o Ask questions in class to seek clarification
          o Actively engage in the lesson
          o Follow written and oral directions
          o Copy all information and show all work as directed
          o Seek accuracy on all assignments
          o Seek help from peers, parents, friends,teacher
          o Maintain an organized binder/notebook with all materials, assignments, resources, notes, etc.
          o Accurately copy all assignments and check assignment book/planner each night
          o Make-up all work on time
          o Use all classroom resources.
          o Prepare for and participate in âRetake Quizâ and "Retest"
          o Check PSConnect (Gradespeed) actively and respectfully approach instructors when inquiring about grades.

I am a graduate of West Virginia University. After a career in college student housing, I entered the teaching profession 13 years ago. Surprisingly, Science was not my favorite class growing up. Now, I LOVE Science! I really enjoy seeing students grow and explore their curiosities! When school is not in session, I spend my time READING, watching/playing sports, and spending as much time as possible traveling the country visiting our family and friends!

I earned my B.S. degree in Mathematics at Louisiana State University in 2010. I then went on to earn my M.S. degree in Mathematics at the University of Houston. I worked at for a seismic data company for 2 years as a processing geophysicist. I enjoyed my work but it was nothing compared to the joys of teaching I experienced as a teaching assistant at the University of Houston while earning my Master's degree. I chose to earn my Alternative Certification in Math 7-12 and since then I have been teaching!

I am a born and raised Houstonian. I attended and graduated from HISD Schools (Poe Elementary, Johnston (Meyerland) Middle School and Lamar High School). I later attended UT Arlington where I graduated with a Linguistics major, a minor in Korean and a TESOL certification. On the weekends I enjoy trying new foods, watching scary movies and hanging out with friends and family.
