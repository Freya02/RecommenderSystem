Poco F1 review – Premiumly Awesomely Awesome

Poco F1 review – Premiumly Awesomely Awesome

Gogi Rana August 22, 2018 Tech 144 Comments

A new brand has entered the Indian markets, it is called POCO and it is a Xiaomi brand. The new brand launched their first smartphone in India called the Poco F1. This is Snapdragon 845 octa core powered and price starts from Rs. 20,999.


First of all why a new brand, I guess when users look at the Xiaomi brand they are looking for quality product at cheaper price. So probably the Poco brand was created to cater to Mid Premium segment, for those looking for a better, powerful and latest hardware and are ready to spend. Also since Poco is backed by Xiaomi users will be comfortable with this new brand.


There is a market in the mid premium segment, but not as much as in the budget segment, another reason for creating the Poco brand is to have a separate sales figure not affecting the Xiaomi sales that does really good for under Rs. 20K.


Poco F1 review


Poco F1 unboxing – do check the video review where I have done the unboxing of this product. I got the Poco F1 Armored Edition. Inside the box you will get the handset, SIM ejector pin, user manual, warranty card, data cable (USB to USB Type C) and travel charger 12V/1.65A. SAR Value as mentioned on the box is 0.719 head and 0.746 body. This product is Made in India.


The unit that I got is Armored Edition made of Kevlar material, it is really tough and made so as to avoid users from using a case for protection. Build and finishing is awesome and handset feels really good to hold and operate. The other Poco F1 variant is policarbonate body.


Poco F1 is Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 octa core powered and also using Liquid Cooling Technology to enhance overall performance in the long run. You can say this is specially made for gaming users in mind.


MIUI 9 runs out of the box based on Oreo, there is Poco Launcher and some interesting stuffs like ability to use mobile data during VoLTE calls on the secondary SIM. The 845 chipset supports dual VoLTE. This F1 comes with Hybrid dual SIM slots.


There is LED notification, OTG is supported and the Poco F1 is loaded with all the important sensors that you will get in a premium smartphone. The Unit that I got is special edition it comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB ROM.


Screen is 6.18 inches supporting FHD+ resolution and it does come with a notch. Screen aspect ratio is 18.7:9. Screen is Corning Gorilla protected.


The moment I opened the box and started using the handset, I just fell in love with it. The overall performance was buttery smooth. I got Antutu score of 265593. PUBG game played really well, buttery smooth and heat up was under control.


The Liquid Cooling system will help keep the performance at an optimal level, so you will hardly get any lags and also helps control the heat buildup. In simple words you can continue playing the PUGB game for a much longer period of time.


Overall the Poco F1 is power packed however there is no NFC.


Coming to the camera on the rear there is 12MP + 5MP dual cameras and on the front there is a 20MP camera. Camera quality is excellent, do check the camera samples below. Bokeh looks perfect and so is the edge detection. Camera some with AI features that help get perfect shots in any lighting conditions. F1 can shoot 4K videos. If you need Video Stabilization then shoot in 1080p resolution or below. You can also shoot Slow motion videos at 240 fps.


Poco F1 camera samples


The finger print sensor and the face unlock work almost instantly. The best part is the face unlock works in dark conditions too.


Coming to the battery the Poco F1 houses a 4000 mAh non-removable battery with fast charge QC 3.0 support. It took me about 1 hour 45 minutes for a full charge and battery life – you can expect one day of heavy usage and one and a half day of mixed usage with ease.


So should you buy the Poco F1?


If you are a gaming user you will love the F1 and if you are not a gaming user you still should buy this handset, if it fits your budget.


Poco F1 is for now the cheapest and the best Snapdragon 845 powered handset available in India.


Poco F1 price in India starts from Rs. 20,999.


Poco F1 8GB / 256GB price is Rs. 29,999 Armored edition
Poco F1 6GB / 64 GB Rs. 20,999
6GB / 128GB Rs. 23,999
8GB / 256GB Rs. 28,999.

    How can I add Bank, Insurance, Other Bulk SMS send via Financial Institution to Private ?
    As an Individual Contact I can set for Private Messaging.
    But what about SMS received from Banks, Financial Institutes, Insurance company (e.g. HDFCBK, LICIND) As they as sending SMS via system and dont have any Mobile Nos, hence we cant Store their numbers to add such messages move to Private box.

          o Shubham Jaishwal August 25, 2018

            Dear Yarn, Please do check the gaming reviews before giving such views. They both can handle HDR at Ultra Settings. And yes it’s about the same performance. I think you should not put views about Exynos used in Samsung S series phones after using J series phones and that rule too applies on Kirin processor. You never know it may be Honor Play who pushed MI to launch it at such an attractive price. Let that Ugly beast(Poco F1) come in the market. I remember how people praised the launch of Redmi Note 3. Back, it looks like my Redmi note 3 with just an extra circular ring that for the camera. Why were all the reviewers provided and asked to unbox armoured edition only? Because that polycarbonate body just sucks. Wait friend wait, time will clear the clouds. Don’t forget if the processor was the only thing to be considered at that time when Redmi Note 3 launched Lenovo Zuk Z2 would have definitely changed the scenario but it failed.

    Gogi Ji,
    Thanks for review. Strangely, I purchased all my electronic items (mobile, tab, smart tv, fan …) based on your reviews and they turn out to be perfect for me.
    Should I wait for mi 8 or go with poco f1? What would you suggest: 6gb ram or 8gb ram in poco f1? I somewhere heard there will be performance issues if you have more than sufficient ram. I can stretch my budget if 8gb ram variant is good in the long run for 2-3 years as updates make the device slow if ram is less. I have been using my mi 4i till now. It got damaged and it has become slow also.
    I use mobile mostly for Internet, photos and sometimes gaming…

        There is noticeably margin in pricing.
        RN5 Pro is 14999
        Mi A2 is 16999
        Poco F1 is 20999
        So there is 2000 ₹ gap between RN5 Mi A2 & 400o₹ gap between mi A2 Poco F1 .I dont understand why such people saying xiaomi killing its own phones. Do u think xiaomi is fool? Its we who sud b happy that we are getting such high end specs at low price…

    It’s a dejavu feeling, history is repeating itself after around 3 years. Couple of year back , we had a flood of affordable flagships priced in the vicinity of 20k. Mi3, OnePlus one and later on OnePlus 3 letv max, le 2 and mi5 and Lenovo z2 plus.
    Most of them offered flagship SD 820 SOC near 20k bracket. The mid-range bracket maxed at 12k with redmi note 3 and le 2 sharing honors. SD 650 and 652 were better performing SOC before Sd 625 came and took over though less performance but better battery life.
    Father that all of them started competing with established players. OnePlus and xiaomi increased prices and almost reached level of earlier Samsung flagships.
    The popularity of only two online platforms ensured less competition and prices remained same even 6 to 8 months after launch.
    However as companies like vivo Asus and realme joined the show , xiaomi gave us Poco.
    The focus of Poco is pure performance and that’s why it cut corners on other things to make it a real affordable flagship speced phone

    selfie cam is awesome.
    but i doubt the rear cam quality
    look at some simple shots after zooming
    doesn’t looks great.
    BTW killer phone at this price.

    sir,
    how durable poly carbonate material ?
    design is not new – its like old moto G series phones

    Reply
      + Swaminathan August 22, 2018

        Polycarbonate is a very tough material and in the launch they said paint job is done over Polycarbonate. Ideally the phone will not break with or without the cover if it fells on the back side. Both Kevlar and Polycarbonate is used for bullet proof application and Kevlar is much premium and scratch proof. If they offer Kevlar cover as an accessory just go for it

        It cannot be Oneplus 6 killer, since it has excellent build quality and Amoled display.

            yes, but vivo and oppo did to much. And still China’s no 1 selling smartphone. They never feature slow mo and 4k recording in mid range and top mid budget.

    I wanted to buy new mobile since last 2 months and literally hated xiaomi for launching new mobile like mi8, mi 8 se and mi max3 in china and not to India, i was in the dilemma to buy honor play but fortunately i waited for poco as i need snapdragon chip and now i am very much happy, this will be my next phone. By the way xiaomi has killed all other phones with this pricing, no competition at all. Love you xiaomi.
