Galaxy lovers, rejoice! Samsung's big summer show, Galaxy Unpacked, kicks off today. The event sets the stage for Samsung's newest suite of consumer devices, including the long-awaited Galaxy Note 9.


What to Expect


The phone is the center of the Samsung universe, so we can expect a successor to last year's Galaxy Note 8. The Galaxy Note 9 (or, who knows, maybe we'll call it the Note X) probably won't be a major departure from last year's phone, but we're looking for improvements to the camera, battery, and pen support. After a leak on Samsung's own website, we also know that Samsung plans to introduce a new smartwatch, called the Galaxy Watch.


What else might Samsung show off? We've heard rumors of a wireless charging device for your new Galaxy phone and watch, and a Bixby-supported smart speaker. But you'll have to tune into the show's livestream to find out for sure.


How to Watch


The event starts at 11 am Eastern in New York. That's 8 am on the Pacific coast. You can watch the livestream right at the top of this page, or on Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked website. You can also watch from the company's YouTube channel using the YouTube app on your smart TV, Roku box, or Apple TV. We'll be covering the event with written analysis, so check back on Wired.com for updates on everything Samsung announces.
