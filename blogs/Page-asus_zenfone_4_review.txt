Focal Range


The Asus Zenfone 4's main fixed focal length lens is equivalent to 25mm in 35mm camera terms. It also has a second 8 megapixel rear camera with a lens that is equivalent to a super-wide focal length of 12mm in 35mm camera terms.

Super Resolution


The Super Resolution mode captures a 48 megapixel image, 4x larger than the native resolution of the main camera, but the resulting image suffers from a distinct lack of fine detail, so much so that we wouldn't recommend using it.

Macro


The Asus Zenfone 4 is able to focus as close as about 5cm from a subject. We found this claim to be accurate, though autofocusing does occasionally struggle to lock on at this kind of range.

Flash


The Asus Zenfone 4 uses a LED flash, and as usual for this technology, it gives a weaker flash burst than a standard xenon camera flash.

Night


Thanks to the 4-axis optical image stabilisation system, wide f/1.8 maximum aperture and maximum shutter speed of 32 seconds, the Asus Zenfone 4 performs well at night. This image was taken at the camera's ISO 25 sensitivity at a shutter speed of 32 seconds, and though there's some noise and detail smoothing, the result is still comparable to what a typical compact camera would produce.

Panorama


The Asus Zenfone 4's automatic sweep panorama mode works well and lets you stop panning at will. The results aren't always perfect, but ghosting is rare. The Asus Zenfone 4 has enough processing power to capture panoramas at fairly high resolutions - they are usually around 992 vertical pixels, with a maximum width of 9600 pixels.
