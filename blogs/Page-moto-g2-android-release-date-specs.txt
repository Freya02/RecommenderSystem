The image above showcases what appears to be a leaked photo of the Moto G2, Motorola’s followup to their much-loved Moto G smartphone. Here’s what you need to know about the G2.


1. Moto G2 Leaked Image Came From a Spanish Blog

The leaked images of the Moto G2 came from the Spanish-Galician Android blog Mallando no Android. The tech blog BGR notes that the report from Mallando no Android lacks any info about pricing or release dates.


However, SlashGear believes the Moto G2 will be available later this year, or perhaps in early 2015.


2. Moto G2 Has Modest Specs


Check out a review of the original Moto G in the video above.


The Moto G line isn’t the most premium offering, but is designed to provide an affordable handset that offers a smooth user experience. BGR notes the Moto G2 specs include “a quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor, a 720p display with a pixel density of 320 pixels per inch, dual SIM support and an 8-megapixel rear camera.”


The current Moto G has pretty similar specs, though the G2 would be a nice step up in terms of the camera. The current Moto G has just a 5 MP rear camera, compared to the rumored 8MP rear camera on the G2.

3. Moto G2 May Cost Less Than Moto G


Check out the audio clip above for some recent Moto G news.


While it is too early to know exactly what the new Moto G2 will cost, some bloggers are already speculating that the Moto G2 will be priced lower than the Moto G. Android Beat writes:


“As for pricing, nothing is known, though it wouldn’t be at all surprising if Motorola launches the Moto G2 for a price lower than the $179 price tag of the original.”


4. The Original Moto G Was a Big Seller

Android Authority reports that the original Moto G was the best-selling phone in the company’s history, and was particularly popular in India.



While precise numbers were not revealed in the report, it was stated that Motorola’s Moto G phone “far exceeded” initial expectations. With so many people already owning a Moto G and looking to upgrade, it is possible that the Moto G2 will also perform well when it is released.


5. Moto G2 Looks Like the Moto E


You can see a comparison of the Moto E and Moto G in the video above.


Phandroid, along with many other tech blogs, have noted that the leaked image of the Moto G2 looks a lot like the Moto E. Phandroid notes:


“The rest of the device reveals a design language akin to what we got on the Moto E — it’s rather conservative and ordinary, but does include front-facing speaker grills. It’s not meant to be flashy, but it should look good enough that anyone who wants one won’t feel bad to carry one.”
