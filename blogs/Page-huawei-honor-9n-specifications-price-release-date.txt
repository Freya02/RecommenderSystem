Huawei Honor 9N – Specifications, Price And Release Date

July 31, 2018

Finally, the long-awaited smartphone has made its way to the UAE market. Huawei’s sub-brand has launched the Huawei Honor 9N smartphone just a days ago. With this new smartphone, the company makes its place in the mid-range segment. Earlier this year, the brand has introduced Honor 9 Lite with interesting features like quad-cameras, large display and more. Now its successor too, packs in a few additional aspects and improvements. So let us check out what are the features it carries and if the Huawei Honor 9N price in Dubai is really worth it.


Huawei Honor 9N Features:


Similar to the previous model, this Huawei Honor smartphone is specially recognized for its design that includes the popular Apple’s notch design. The key aspect that catches attention at the first glance is the unique design. It is interesting that the company is further improving the design segment even if the device is of a budget range and Honor 9N is no exception. This handset features a reflective glass rear panel that gives it a premium look and resembles with that of the Honor 10. The device is lightweight, easy to hold and to carry. It sports an IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen display with an aspect ratio of 19:9. The screen size measures 5.84-inches and gives a resolution of 1080×2280 pixels.


Its predecessor Honor 9 Lite is one of the very few smartphones that have dual cameras both at the front and back. However, for the Honor 9N, the company has stuck to the single 16MP selfie camera at the front with support to video recording at 1080 pixels. Despite being a single sensor, it takes spectacular snaps with fine details. Besides, it gets LED flash support that brightens up pictures in low light conditions. And at the back, it carries the same dual cameras featuring 13MP plus 2MP sensors, which delivers impressive photos. Compared to the Honor 9 Lite, this camera is slightly improved, especially in the depth effect department.
