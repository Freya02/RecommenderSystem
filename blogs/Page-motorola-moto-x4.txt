Motorola debuts the Moto X4; a mid-range effort with dual cameras and Alexa


Motorola has reintroduced the X series through the Moto X4; a mid-range smartphone that brings a dual-camera setup and access to Amazon’s Alexa.


Lenovo has leveraged the Motorola brand to debut some interesting ideas into the market space – such as the Moto Mods concept that continues on the flagship Z series to this day – and now the company is attempting to carve out a new niche in the form of the Moto X4.


The X4 is, as its name might imply, the fourth generation Moto X handset; and where prior efforts have been premium affairs, the Moto 4X is instead aimed at the mid-range of the market. That’s a good thing, as this is a smartphone that arrives with two distinct offers for consumers picking and choosing between handsets; a dual-camera array and access to Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant.

The Moto 4X brings metal and glass to market rather than plastic, and bears an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. Under the hood, there’s Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 835 processor, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of expandable storage in addition to a 3,000mAh battery.


Beyond a savvy 5.2″ HD display, the device leverages two 12-megapixel primary cameras in its array; both capture colour, though one lens sports dual-pixel autofocus and the other carries a 120-degree wide-angle field of view.


The 4X’s front camera sports a 16-megapixel sensor with an ‘adaptive light mode’ for better low light performance. Both camera sets will benefit from Motorola’s overhauled camera app, which is capable of recognising landmarks and objects and yielding further information – not unlike Bixby Vision on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8.


Users in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany will be able to use Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant even when their device is locked, though the device will, of course, still afford access to Google Assistant.


The Moto X4 is set for sale in Super Black and Sterling Blue, and is expected to retail for some $475 USD.
