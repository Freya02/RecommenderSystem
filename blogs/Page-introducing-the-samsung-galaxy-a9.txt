If you're a Samsung fan, then you're sure to love the Samsung Galaxy A series, the latest of which is the impressive Samsung Galaxy A9. Alongside its affordable price tag, you'll find a collection of impressive specs - including the world's first four-lens smartphone camera.


Want to know more? We take a closer look at the new Samsung Galaxy A9 below.


Samsung Galaxy A9 Design


Following true Samsung tradition, the Galaxy A9 has a sleek design that any user will be proud of. Smooth curved corners ensure the phone is a pleasure to hold, and a stunning metal frame is encased in 3D rear glass. On the front, the device is protected by strong, scratch-resistant glass protecting Samsung’s iconic Infinity Display.


The Galaxy A9 is a convenient size, measuring 162.5 x 77 x 7.8mm. Not too large and not too thick, it sits perfectly in the hand while housing a notable 6.3-inch screen. It's a lightweight smartphone as well, at 183g.


Samsung Galaxy A9 Display


If you're partial to large-screen smartphones, then the Samsung Galaxy A9 won't disappoint. The 6.3-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity Display has been created to deliver a truly immersive viewing experience. Whether you're in a dark environment or outside in the bright sunlight, you can expect nothing less than an amazing, detailed picture with rich, vivid colours and a sharp contrast.


The Galaxy A9 also has an 80.5% screen-to-body ratio, so you can make the most of a large display without having to put up with a bulky handset. You'll find Samsung's Always On Display feature on board too, which means you'll be able to view important information like the date, time, weather forecast and any incoming notifications even when the phone is asleep. Super convenient if you have your hands full.


Samsung Galaxy A9 Power


Even though the Samsung Galaxy A9 is mid-range in terms of price, you'd be wrong to think that the tech under the hood as anything less than premium. For a start, there's an impressive 6GB RAM on board. This, combined with Android Oreo, and an octa-core processor ensures an uninterrupted, seamless performance, whther you're playing next-generation games or just browsing social media.


When it comes to storage, you won't find yourself falling short either. Alongside the internal 128GB available, you'll also have the option to expand the handset to 512GB with a microSD - perfect if you're into shooting videos on your phone.


Samsung Galaxy A9 Camera


When you mention the Samsung Galaxy A9, there's one feature that has everybody talking. This handset is, in fact, the world's first ever smartphone to have a camera system with four lenses. This quad-lens camera system can be found on the rear of the Samsung Galaxy A9, and all four lenses work together to produce an outstanding picture. The main camera comes in at 24MP, with an F1.7 aperture to ensure images are bright and always crystal clear.


On top of this there's the 10MP telephoto camera - ideal for when you need to zoom - and a 5MP camera with a f2.2 lens for capturing depth into your shots. Last but not least, you'll find the 8MP ultra-wide camera. With a 120-degree lens, you'll be able to squeeze even more of the action into one shot. Even with so much going on at the rear of the device, Samsung hasn't forgot about the front-facing camera. Simply perfect for Instagram and Snapchat lovers, the 24MP selfie camera will always find your good side. Photos will look so flawless you might even want to ditch the filters.


Samsung Galaxy A9 Battery


Finally, battery life. While the Samsung Galaxy A9 doesn't support wireless charging, you can enjoy fast charge for when you need to power up in a hurry. Coming in at a sizable 3,800 mAh, you can expect power all day long.


Alongside all of this, the Samsung Galaxy A9 has a fingerprint scanner and face recognition technology on board too. Love the sound of this smartphone? Take a look at the best deals available at Mobiles.co.uk.
