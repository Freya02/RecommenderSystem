12 Life-Changing Law of Attraction Affirmations

You have probably heard about Law of Attraction affirmations before… and you are probably wondering if, and how, they work. Here are some affirmations you can try yourself. And the way you should use them in order for them to have the desired effect.


The Truth About Law of Attraction Affirmations


Affirmations for self esteem work. They are an important part of manifesting and bringing dreams from imagination to reality.


But there is a critical element here. And that is belief.


Without belief – if you feel that you are lying to yourself – the affirmations will not generate the results you want.


Your vibration (or belief) has to match your desire. That’s how the two will be brought together.


An example: If you are affirming, “I make $50,000 a month from my business” but you haven’t even printed a business card yet or put the word out there that you are in business, you will have a major discrepancy between what is, and what can be.


But in order to make that fifty grand a month, you have to visualize it, and talk about it, right?


So how do you overcome this contrariety?


How do you move from ‘seeing is believing’ to a mindset of ‘believing is seeing’? Or from seeing the current situation and having zero proof that the affirmations work to a place of belief where you allow the creative process to unfold?


What Is The Law of Attraction?


The Law of Attraction is very simple and straightforward: You attract what you believe.


If you say an affirmation and immediately cloud it with doubt – “how will I ever achieve this?” or “who would ever want what I have to offer?” you will only become frustrated. Your reality will effortlessly match your vibration.


Every single time, without fail, you will attract what you expect.


Look around at your circumstances. They are a direct result of what you believe.


You have the power to create something better.


So, the trick to shifting from ‘seeing is believing’ and adopting ‘believing is seeing’ is all about vibration, and feeling good.


When you doubt, you cause resistance in your vibration.


Doubt does not feel good. Fear does not feel good. Procrastination does not feel good. Struggle does not feel good.


They are all forms of resistance!


Use the following affirmations to help create the shift, without causing resistance.


Your unconscious and conscious mind will accept these affirmations because there is no disparity between what is and what can be. And that is when the affirmations will work.


Important: if you don’t resonate with the language used here, make up your own affirmations. They must ring true to you. Everything is vibration.


12 Affirmations To Get You Started


Positive vibration feels good; negative vibration feels bad. So as you create and say or write affirmations, be sure that they feel good to you.


As you begin to embody these affirmations and believe them, you will start attracting what you want.


The most important rules other than that your affirmations feel good, is that you say them with emotion, in the present tense, and use I AM.


I AM is a creative force unlike any other!


Try some of these affirmations on for size. Pick the ones that resonate with you; tweak the rest to reflect your own desires and goals.


1. I AM receiving abundance now in expected and unexpected ways.


2. I AM increasingly confident in my ability to create the life I desire.


3. I AM acting on inspiration and insights and I trust my inner guidance.


4. I AM giving and receiving all that is good and all that I desire.


5. I AM receiving infinite, inexhaustible and immediate abundance.


6. I AM creating my life according to my dominant beliefs; and I AM improving the quality of those beliefs.


7. I AM constantly striving to raise my vibration through good thoughts, words and actions.


8. I AM making a meaningful contribution to the world and I AM wonderfully compensated for my contribution.


9. I AM willing to believe that I AM the creator of my life experience.


10. I AM willing to believe that by raising my vibration, I will attract more of what I desire.


11. I AM willing to believe that by focusing on feeling good, I make better choices that lead to desired results.


12. I AM worthy of love, abundance, success, happiness and fulfillment.


It’s very important to plant the seed of possibility in your mind – this will raise your vibration because optimism and positivity help remove resistance (doubt, fear, etc.).


Remember to always focus on what you want to attract, not on what is.


There are no regulations as far as length of time spent speaking affirmations.


What’s more important is the INTENSITY.


Mumbled, halfhearted affirmations are as useless as an umbrella in a tornado!


Intensely felt, wholeheartedly spoken affirmations are clear signals that you want THIS.


It’s All About Believing it


Belief in yourself can be created as a mental habit.


The more you tell yourself something (in a way that does not cause internal resistance), the more you will believe it.


It comes down to choice.


Most of your beliefs were created unconsciously, but they were still created as a consequence of choice – you CHOSE to believe that what someone said was true.


Therefore, there’s no reason you can’t imprint positive, proactive and self-affirming beliefs instead of negative, reactive and self-defeating beliefs.


You can choose.


How do you make the most of your Law of Attraction affirmations?


Infuse them with lots and lots of positive emotion.


They should feel good on a core level. Imagine yourself as already having what you want. How do you feel at that moment? Take that feeling and apply it to your affirmation! Not only will this help build belief, but it will also help override any negativity that might surround your desire.


If you learn to use Law of Attraction affirmations using BELIEF and EMOTION that is untainted by fear or doubt, they will, absolutely, become part of you.


You will embody them.


You will radiate them.


And the results will come flooding back to you in many delightful ways!
