Say Hello to Android Oreo

No Comments

Sweet just got even sweeter with the new Android OS update that gives you faster speeds, longer battery life, split-screen capabilities, smart text selection, improved notifications, autofill framework for your trickiest of passwords, and of course, the all new Google Play Protect, helping to ensure none of your apps become compromised.*


We’re happy to confirm Android™ 8.0 Oreo™ will be joining our fleet of Motorola smartphones, starting this fall.


Below is the full list of our smartphones that will be getting the Oreo OS upgrade:

  * moto z
  * moto z Droid
  * moto z Force Droid
  * moto z Play
  * moto z Play Droid
  * moto z2 Play
  * moto z2 Force Edition
  * moto x4
  * moto g5
  * moto g5 Plus
  * moto g5S
  * moto g5S Plus

Stay tuned for updates on Motorola software upgrades here, including details on the specifics by country or carrier.


Since the time of posting this, we have learned of some errors in our marketing materials around Android O upgrades for moto g4 Plus. It’s our general practice for the moto g family to get one major OS upgrade per device, so it wasn’t originally planned for Android O. But it’s important to us we keep our promises, so in addition to the N upgrade it has already received, we will be upgrading moto g4 Plus to Android O. Because this is an unplanned upgrade, it will take some time to fit into our schedule, we’ll update our software upgrade page when we have more info.
