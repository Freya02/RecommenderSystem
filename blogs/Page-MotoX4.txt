will I need protection plan?


My brother said before I buy a Moto X4 to replace my Nexus 5x I need to research if I need to buy the Fi protection plan. Is there any reason to? I mean the phone is only $199 and has 1-year manufacturer warranty and the plan would be $60/year plus a $79 deductible to replace, so.... yeah. Does this phone have some lurking defect (like the bootloop & motherboard issues of the 5x) that will make me regret buying it or need the plan?


Edit: My Nexus 5x was recently hit with the fatal bootloop just shy of 2 yrs, which is why I am hoping to have something that will last longer.

Lately indeed this seems like a photography blog. Oh well, guess I need to unsubscribe.

Anyone found a way to remove the google bar with the pie update?


GoogleFi tells me that it's default, anyone found a way to get rid of the Google bar on the home screen with the new pie update on Motos?
