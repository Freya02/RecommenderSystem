If you’re a photo lover who wants to stand out from the crowd, ZenFone 5 Lite is the perfect smartphone for you. Whether your favorite subject is eye-popping scenery, scrumptious food, urban exploration or simply fun times with the people in your life, the pocket-friendly ZenFone 5 Lite turns your experiences into treasured digital memories. Its unique four-camera system has wide-angle lenses at both front and rear for capturing even more of what you love, wherever you are and whatever the situation.

Four Cameras
Ready for anything
ZenFone 5 Lite has a world-leading quad-camera system that takes your photo experience to the next level. At both front and rear, it features a high-resolution main camera — 20MP Sony® at the front, 16MP at the rear — plus a second wide-angle camera with a 120° field of view, giving you the best of all possible worlds for your photography. Whether you love selfies, wefies, action shots, portraits, landscapes or 4K UHD videos, ZenFone 5 Lite is unbeatable. This advanced hardware is combined with the latest ASUS PixelMaster technology, which gives you a Portrait mode with beautiful bokeh, a DSLR-like Pro mode for fine manual control, and a 10-level Beauty mode. And for perfect point-and-shoot operation, Auto mode now features automatic HDR and low-light optimization.

Creativity without limits
We believe that true photo lovers deserve more than just a secondary rear camera that only works together with the main camera. With ZenFone 5 Lite we’ve added 120° wide-angle cameras at both front and rear for taking ultra wide shots. Each of these can be used individually, removing the limits on your creativity and giving you the freedom to tailor your shots: with ZenFone 5 Lite it’s much easier to compose the perfect selfie, wefie, landscape, portrait or group shot.

Selfies that are true to you
Selfies on ZenFone 5 Lite are in a class of their own.

It can also take crisp, clear Full HD (1080p) selfie videos that will entrance your audience — they’ll feel as though they’re right there with you! The two cameras and Softlight LED flash let you tailor your selfie style with ease: keep it up-close and personal, include the scenery, or let your friends join in for the ultimate wefie fun.

Stand out from the crowd
