I don't understand the logic behind the outraged Mi A1 users since the A2 started getting Pie. This is how things have worked forever. The newer device always gets the OS update first. Why would they update a device that's over a year old first before a device that just came out a couple months ago? I'd be pissed if I bought an A2 and the A1 got pie first.

Lol yeah totally. It's verging into meme territory. It's as sure-fire as Xiaomi releasing a new SD625 powered device.

I still don't have it. My guess is that it will probably take few more hours to be available for everyone

Beta is out, that's about it, I have it, it's pretty stable so expect it at like January (Just a guess, no one is certain).

Through the MIUI Global App, there was some registration to enter the beta. It ended 2 weeks ago but it got extended and ended 5 days ago. The first beta update was yesterday. I don't think anyone can join and not everyone was accepted.

Do note,


  * You must update to V9.6.17.0.ODIMIFE in order to receive the Android 9 Pie update.


  * The update will gradually be available to all Mi A2 users by Christmas. Please do go to settings - system - system update - check for update if you did not receive the Pie update this time. The system will also notify you when the update is available. Enjoy and thanks.
