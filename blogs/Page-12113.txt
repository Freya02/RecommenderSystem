09:05AM EST - Today Honor is announcing a new smartphone coming to EMEA and the Americas: the Honor 7X. The 7X has actually already been announced for the Asia-Pacific market, however Honor is emphasizing its message for western markets with its launch today in London.


09:07AM EST - Going to start in about 20 minutes here


09:23AM EST - Under than 10 minutes. Showing all the Honor PR videos on the screen while everyone is sitting down


09:25AM EST - This is my third Honor launch if I remember correctly, after the Honor 8 and 6X. The Honor 8 had Brooklyn Beckham as their 'celebrity' on stage.


09:26AM EST - Honor likes to promote itself as a young person, 'on-line' brand


09:26AM EST - Technically it is a sub-brand of Huawei, but with different design, advertising and sales departments


09:27AM EST - But Huawei reps know next to nothing on Honor, and somewhat vice versa


09:27AM EST - The Honor 7X is the launch product today. It has been plastered all over the marketing materials


09:27AM EST - This event is called the 'global launch', but technically it has already been launched in China / parts of Asia


09:29AM EST - We're expecting this launch variant (the 'global' launch variant?) to be pretty much identical in design, but perhaps with slightly different LTE band configurations for Europe, Africa, and the Americas


09:30AM EST - Of course, the press event we're covering today allows Honor to go through all of their new features and hardware


09:31AM EST - The Twitter tag for the event is #MaxYourView, alluding to the 'full-screen-like interface' of the display


09:34AM EST - 3 minute warning


09:37AM EST - Opening video, emphasizing the dual camera with the IOOI styling


09:38AM EST - BMX style riders on the stage. A brand for young people, you know

09:43AM EST - This is an odd video


09:44AM EST - Now the Senior Product Manager hits the stage, Neils someone?


09:44AM EST - George Zhao, President of Honor, to the stage

    No USB-C, late kernel sources, Kirin CPU? Hard pass. Reply

    * ads295 - Tuesday, December 05, 2017 - link

      You'd actually not consider buying a phone due to no USB-C? Maybe we really are as dumb as the industry wants us to be...
      For what it's worth, Kirin is now on par with the big guys, in what seems like an impossibly short span of time. Reply

        You could reverse the logic.

        Personally I will not buy anything unless it supports USB 3.1 power delivery (and supports being host while being charged at the same time). Since only USB-C can be USB 3.1 I need USB-C (though USB-C does not imply USB 3.1 unfortunately). Reply

         * UtilityMax - Wednesday, December 06, 2017 - link

           I totally understand your requirements, but this is a sub-250 smartphone that tries to feel as premium as possible, and Huawei has succeeded, but they gotta cheat somewhere. Hence micro-usb connector, 2.4GHz only wifi, and camera won't shoot 4K video. But the phone feels great in most other aspects. I got the previous version, the 6X, and couldn't be happier. Most people looking for the phone in this price range would be served adequately with old USB. Reply

      * sonny73n - Wednesday, December 06, 2017 - link

        There's nothing to consider. I'd definitely not buying an Android phone without USB-C, period.
        
        By the way, I'm not an Apple fan but Apple has the best connector ever (the lighting connector). Reply

      And for what it's worth, Kirin is playing with the big boys since they moved to FinFET. They've developed incredibly fast considering how long they've been around Reply
