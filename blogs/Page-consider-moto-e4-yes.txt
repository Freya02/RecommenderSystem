Should You Consider The Moto E4? YES!

The Moto E4 has finally launched in India at a price of Rs 9,999, and it’s already set the internet abuzz with hype.


Biggest Battery Ever


Perhaps the biggest talking point of the phone is the 5000 mAh battery. Moto has been known to offer the pure Android experience and since its inception in 2014 it has been incredibly successful in the Indian market.


So far, the Moto E used to be the most budget-friendly series, but this year we’ve seen the Moto C take that place. The Moto E4 is in direct competition with one of the bestselling smartphone in the country, the Redmi Note 4.


Specifications


The phone has a big 5.5 inch full HD display which is pretty decent considering the price range the phone is in. On the design front, Moto E4 now sports a metal body, and has a huge, prominent round camera on the back.


The phone has a premium look to it unlike the other Moto E models. That along with a two-day battery life being promised for the phone seems to be an impressive deal.


A MediaTek MT6737 Quad-core processor clocked at 1.3GHz coupled with 3GB RAM and 32 GB of internal storage make it pretty slick for an entry level phone standard. The phone can have the storage expanded to 128 GB as well.


Moto E4 comes with a 13MP rear camera, and a 5MP front camera, there’s flash on the front and the back of the smartphone.


Verdict


In conclusion the Moto E4 Plus might just appeal to users who prefer the stock Android experience, and want a big battery on their device.


Considering one for yourself? How about getting it for even cheaper when you sell your phone on Cashify?
