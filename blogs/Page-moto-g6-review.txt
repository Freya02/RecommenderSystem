The best smartphones from brands like Apple and Samsung cost close to $1,000, but you don‚Äôt need to spend all of that money to get a high-performing device.


Money expert Clark Howard bought the Moto G6 in June 2018 and said he really liked it after a few weeks of testing.

Clark Howard tries out the Moto G6 Android smartphone


During our Team Clark editorial meeting, Clark told us that the phone is ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù and he didn‚Äôt really miss the normal phone he carries around, his Samsung Galaxy Note8 ($950 retail price).


Read on to learn more about the Moto G6 and Clark‚Äôs unbought and unbossed opinion‚Ä¶


Price


Most retailers including Motorola are offering the G6 with 32 GB of internal storage for $249.99, but we‚Äôve seen it on sale for as low as $199.99. Get updates from ClarkDeals.com here.

Key features


One thing that makes the Moto G6 phone special is that you can buy it unlocked from Best Buy, Amazon and other retailers, and it will work with all major U.S. carriers.


Here‚Äôs a full list of the technical specifications for the device:

  * 5.7‚Ä≥ Full HD+ display with an 18:9 aspect ratio
  * 1.8 GHz octa-core processor and 4G speed
  * Rear camera hardware: 12 MP & 5 MP dual rear cameras, f/1.8 aperture
  * Front camera hardware: 8 MP
  * Advanced imaging software
  * 32 GB of internal storage expandable to 128 GB
  * All-day battery
  * TurboPower charging (hours of power in just minutes of charging)
  * Multi-function fingerprint reader
  * Water repellent nano-coating inside and out
  * Unlocked for all major U.S. carriers, including Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and Google Fi

Pros and cons


Overall, Clark said the Moto G6 is a fantastic bargain. The 5.7-inch screen display (bigger than an iPhone 8 Plus!) and long battery life are two of Clark‚Äôs favorite features.


The one thing that didn‚Äôt impress him? The performance of Moto G6‚Äôs camera when taking pictures indoors:


‚ÄúUsually when you look at a cheaper phone, there are going to be all kinds of compromises. And if I could think of anything on this phone that I‚Äôm not thrilled with, it‚Äôs some of the interior shots that I take. If there‚Äôs decent lighting inside, the phone does fine. If it‚Äôs not decent lighting inside, it‚Äôs a disappointment. Other than that, everything about this Motorola phone is extraordinary.‚Äù


Whether you decide to buy the Moto G6 or any other smartphone, switching wireless carriers is another way to save a lot of money. The best plans and deals start at $10 a month!
