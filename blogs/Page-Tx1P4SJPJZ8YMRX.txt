I saw some comments that Dell does not cover the monitor under its 3yr warranty if this is purchased from Amazon. Is this accurate?

Incorrect. Amazon LLC is an authorized reseller and Dell honors the full 3yr warranty.

This can be done via Dell support "chat", or can be done on your Dell online support account by simply adding the Monitor's Service Tag to your list of products and services. Note that Dell will only provide you with "replacements" -- you cannot get a "refund" from Dell for a monitor purchased from Amazon. So within 30 days, if you want a refund or exchange it is easiest to go through Amazon. After 30 days, Dell will provide full 3 year warranty support the same as if it was purchased from Dell directly.

I received a defective Dell display bought from Amazon (not a marketplace seller), and did not know for sure it was hardware (and not some driver thing) until months had passed--too long for the easy Amazon return. But less than a year--still well within the 3 year warranty. Dell would not even discuss the problem with me or provide any support at all--much less a swap or repair--because I bought the display from Amazon. They were very clear on that, and even investigated separately and sent me follow-up emails on the matter. Amazon, however, made it right in the end--but shame on Dell! This sounds illegal, and it also sounds like it only happens some of the time. But I'm one of the ones it happened to. It was particularly a problem because Dell support asks for a "service tag" even though many Dell monitor models have no such tag. (Maybe with a tagged model you'd still get service? But as far as I can tell, no 24-inch Dell monitors use a service tag--which doesn't stop Dell from asking for one.)
And if there is some special process for getting warranty service on a Dell bought from an authorized reseller (which may be the case), neither Amazon nor Dell themselves know that process. You'd think there would be instructions in the box, and every service representative would know about it. It's not as though buying Dells from Amazon/New Egg/Best Buy/etc. is a rare thing. see less This is still true--at least sometimes--as of 2015.

Here is how I made my Dell/Amazon return. I had one (of about six) monitors fail within a year. Amazon will not take it back. Dell wants the original Amazon order number (there is no service tag). However, when I called Dell direct I learned that all they need is a service tag from anything to write up the RMA. Then, they proceeded to enter the serial number and part number, and then they sent a new monitor and a call tag for the old one. Not super convenient, but not horrible, and there was no trouble from Dell.

The paperwork in the box says three years, and there is no asterisk or even smaller print that says it only applies if purchased through Dell direct. What I really find curious is how some reviews state the warranty is only one year, yet this particular monitor, the 3014, has not been available for a year, so how would anyone know they're only honoring the first year of warranty?

Hi -- I'm happy to say I haven't had to put in a warranty call, but I do see that several people have commented that Dell is refusing support if it's bought from Amazon. If that's the case it sounds like the start of a class action to me. Nothing in the description says that it is not covered by the standard manufacturer's warranty. But I wonder if the three year warranty is an inducement that Dell offers to get customers to buy directly from them?
