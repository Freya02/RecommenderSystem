* Apple took to the stage today to announce three phones and a brand new smartwatch. Read about the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, Apple Watch 4 here.


You can watch (or rewatch) Apple's livestream here.

Livestream

Today's the day. The biggest iPhone release ever -- both literally and figuratively -- is just hours away.


Apple will kick the proceedings off at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET, starting what's expected to be a long list of product refreshes. Our live preshow starts an hour earlier.

Nothing has been officially confirmed, but the latest leak this morning seems to confirm the iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max names that have been making the rounds for days. That follows the excellent online sleuthing by 9to5Mac, which seemed to confirm that new iPhones -- including the largest-ever 6.5-inch and 6.1-inch iPhones joining a second-gen 5.8-inch model -- and new fourth-generation Apple Watch models are a certainty. Additionally, Apple could unveil the first-ever iPad models with Face ID, as well as a long-rumored MacBook Air replacement -- and that's just for starters.


In other words: If you have even a passing interest in Apple products, or even if you're an Android fanboy looking to see what Google needs to counter with on its Oct. 9 event, you'll want to follow this event live. Here's how.

What to expect


Here's what Apple is anticipated to announce, from the most likely to the more longshot possibilities:

  * Three new iPhones
  * A totally new and redesigned Apple Watch Series 4
  * Release date and pricing for the AirPower charging pad
  * Updated AirPod headphones

We could also see these on Sept. 12. But Apple may wait to unveil them in October, or even later:

Those are just some of the possibilities. Check out our full event preview for more details.
