  * Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Fast approaching

Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Fast approaching


Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Fast approaching


Samsung Galaxy Note 9: Fast approaching


It’ll be here before we know it!


It’s official: the launch is happening on August 9th folks! Tune in at 11AM US EDT from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.


Now, a little info from the rumor mill…


Overall, the Galaxy Note 9 is reported to be quite the combined version of the Note 8 and the Galaxy S9. The Note 9 will have a 6.3-in OLED screen with 2960 x 1440 resolution and an 18.5:9 aspect ratio (plus a maximum brightness of 1150 nits). The overall device size dimension is 160.5 x 74.8 x 8.6 mm.

For all of you note-takers and artists, the S Pen may get a huge upgrade with Bluetooth functionality built-in as Samsung filed this feature with the Federal Communications Commission.


It has also been reported the S pen can take pictures remotely, control music and can be a pointer for presentations--- which may mean that it might have its own small battery for the connection.


Other features for the Galaxy Note 9 could included a rear fingerprint reader, Bixby 2.0 and a Snapdragon 845 chipset or the Samsung Exynos 9810. There will likely be a battery increase too to 4,000mAh from the 3,300mAh from the Note 8.


So far, it looks like the new Samsung device will be available in 5 different colors. The first 3 colors: Black, Gray and Lavender should be available at launch, while Blue and Brown (or closer to Gold) models will only be available at selected areas.


Bonus: there’s already a review for the Note 9.

According to the review, the base model gets a bump in storage up to 128GB with 6GB of RAM inside. Other versions expected to be released will boast 8GB/256GB and 8GB/512GB for some serious backup potential.


While the camera features are quite similar to the Galaxy S9, Russian tech reporter Eldar Murtazin also says it’s quite an incremental upgrade from the Note 8. The rumored price so far in Russia will be around 70,000 Russian Rubles minimum or $1,128.67.


Still deciding if you’ll get the Note 9?


Don’t worry, August 9th will be here before you know it and you’ll have all the info you need to make a decision. If you think it’s the phone for you, we’ll be ready with the screen protectors and cables you’ll need to protect your new investment!


We’ve protected several Samsung devices like the recent Note 8, Galaxy S9 and S9+ (all the way back to the S3!!)
