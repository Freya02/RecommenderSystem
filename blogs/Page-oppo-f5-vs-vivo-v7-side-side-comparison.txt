Camera Shootouts


OPPO F5 vs Vivo V7+: Side-by-side comparison


Published

November 1, 2017

* These days, in the smartphone world, it’s all about the displays and bezels — or the lack thereof. Two nearly borderless contenders are from brands which are known for their selfie capabilities.


The OPPO F5 and Vivo V7+, though still tagged as selfie smartphones, are marketed as “borderless” devices which cost only a fraction of those bezel-less flagships. These recent releases look pretty similar, so we decided to see where the phones differ.


Side-by-side


The OPPO F5 and Vivo V7+ have taller displays with a 18:9 ratio. Both phones are the respective brands’ first attempt at near-borderless displays.


The OPPO F5 has a 6-inch screen while the Vivo V7+’s display is 5.99 inches — not much of a difference. However, the V7+ has a resolution of 720 x 1440 pixels which pales in comparison to the F5’s 1080 x 2160 pixels.


OPPO F5 (left) and Vivo V7+ (right)


Both phones have relocated the fingerprint scanner to the back with identical placements, the only difference being the actual shape of the scanner.


These phones have plastic backs, but they feel far from cheap. Both have a nice matte finish that makes them look premium.


On the upper-right, the OPPO F5 has the SIM card slot and power button; the Vivo V7+ has the volume rocker and power button.


On the other side, the F5 houses the volume rocker while the V7+ has only the SIM slot on there. Both phones have space for two nano-SIMs and a microSD card.


The speaker grilles, micro-USB port, and audio jack are all found at the bottom of the phones.


Admittedly, the only reason I could tell these two phones apart, face up, is the fact that our units came in different colors. I don’t think that will be the case had they been both black. ?


Camera performance


Now, on to the selfies!


To accommodate smaller bezels, the phones have done away with the dual-cam selfie setup. The OPPO F5 has a 20-megapixel front-facing camera while the Vivo V7+ has a 24-megapixel selfie camera and front-facing LED fill light (no need for these ridiculous light cases).


Both have their respective beauty and bokeh modes, though the F5 gets props for a standalone bokeh mode. On the V7+, the bokeh mode can only be done while on beauty mode, but you can always just toggle the beauty filter to zero.


Selfies come out great on both phones, with Vivo’s photos coming out noticeably brighter and more saturated — something most selfie-loving folks seem to prefer. Software bokeh cut-outs are looking pretty good on both, too.


A notable add-on would be the OPPO F5’s built-in artificial intelligence on its front-facing camera. OPPO claims that this feature allows for a beauty mode that’s more natural, even going as far as recognizing the selfie subject’s age, sex, and race for optimum selfie results.


Naturally, a group selfie was in order to test it.


With one tap (auto mode), better and more natural selfies were shot with the OPPO F5, especially compared to previous OPPO releases. The filter did not blur out features and our faces didn’t look washed out!


A comparable selfie is achievable with the V7+ after experimenting with the beauty mode; you have to find just the right settings. A quick zoom on the photos, though, will show you the slight but very important detail on photos from the F5: That are your pores are still visible, making for a more realistic beauty filter.


Both phones are equipped with 20-megapixel rear cameras with an LED flash. Beauty mode is available on the rear cameras for both handsets, though neither have a bokeh feature on this camera.


The shooters are very capable, even under low-light scenarios — without even activating the manual mode, which of course, both phones have. The photo above, however, shows the phones’ varying treatments for the same difficult shot.


The two devices have built-in beauty modes for video, but the V7+ only allows for this feature while on video calls for certain apps, and the OPPO F5 only has the function on its integrated camera app.


What’s inside


The OPPO F5 runs on a MediaTek MT6763T processor with Android 7.1 and ColorOS 3.2. The Vivo V7+ is powered by a Snapdragon 450 processor (a processor comparable to the older Snapdragon 625 as Dan had explained on his Vivo V7+ review) on Android 7.1 with FunTouch OS.


Both have 4GB of memory, but the V7+ has a higher storage capacity at 64GB compared to the F5’s 32GB. The V7+ also has a slightly bigger battery capacity of 3225mAh as opposed to the F5’s 3200mAh capacity.


Which is your GadgetMatch?


These phones deliver the bezel-less experience without having to cough up money for a flagship. At the end of the day, this led to certain sacrifices specs-wise — though that certainly doesn’t mean these aren’t capable devices, because they are.


It just depends where your priorities lie: The OPPO F5 for the more capable beauty mode, or the Vivo V7+ for more vivid photos and the more capable processor.


The main point is: If a bigger screen is your priority, one of these two phones — depending on what type of user you are — may just be your GadgetMatch. Priced at PhP 15,990 (around US$ 305) for the OPPO F5 and PhP 17,990 (close to US$ 355) for the Vivo V7+, these two are definite contenders for the more affordable bezel-less smartphone category.

Huawei, Apple, and Samsung have released their top phones recently, which brings us to what you’ve all been waiting for: a camera shootout!


Not only are these among the fastest handsets in the market, they own some of the best cameras, as well. But because you have to pay a pretty penny to own one, it’s imperative that you make the right choice.


Brand loyalty aside, each one has its own specialty, but which flagship can we consider to be the overall best? While it’s highly subjective, they’re fun to compare nonetheless.


Even more enjoyable: Placing their photos in side-by-side comparisons for you to gander at. We compiled 14 of them in a blind test, all shot in Auto mode with AI applied when needed. Once you’re done pixel peeping at each photo, find out which phone took which picture by checking the answer sheet at the bottom.

Honor 10 Lite vs OPPO F9 vs Vivo V11: Selfie Shootout


Which phone takes the best selfies?


Published


on

January 18, 2019

GadgetMatch

Most of the newly released phones lately don’t just have great rear shooters; they are also equipped with quality front cameras. This only means one thing: They can take good selfies. However, which phone is the best selfie taker?


In this comparison, we’re pitting the new Honor 10 Lite against the OPPO F9 and the Vivo V11.


The Honor 10 Lite is equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera with beautification features and AI scene detection. Both the OPPO F9 and Vivo V11, on the other hand, have 25-megapixel selfie snappers with AI beauty mode.


Without further ado, let’s begin the comparison:


#1


Let’s start with the first set of photos. These were taken without any smoothening or bokeh processing. These are as natural as their selfies can get. Taken inside a well-lit room, the phones had enough light to take a clear photo.

#2


For the second set, we went to the balcony to check how the phones would fare in low-light. The flash setting was on auto to let the phones decide how they should take a low-light selfie. Unsurprisingly, the phones fired up their screen to act as the flash.

#3


All three phones can take portrait-like selfies by applying artificial blur to the background. This set of photos was taken indoors with plenty of light coming in and bokeh mode turned on.

#4


For the final set of selfies, we had bokeh and beauty mode turned on. Both the OPPO F9 and Vivo V11 were set to use AI to determine the level of beauty effect necessary. Meanwhile, the Honor 10 Lite was set to Level 3 (out of 10) to match the smoothening effect of the other two phones. To make it trickier, the photos were taken inside a busy cafe.


This slideshow requires JavaScript.


That ends our selfie comparison using the Honor 10 Lite, OPPO F9, and Vivo V11. Each phone delivers different results in every scenario. Which of the selfies do you like most?


The Honor 10 Lite is officially arriving in the Philippines on January 22. Starting January 26, the phone will be available in all Honor authorized shops and dealers. Also, you may catch the Honor roadshow happening on January 26 in SM North EDSA where the Honor 10 Lite will be on sale and bundled with exciting freebies!

iPhone XR vs Pixel 3: Camera shootout


Which single-camera setup takes better photos?


Published


on

December 3, 2018

Chay Lazaro

In an age where dual and triple cameras have become a standard, two premium flagship smartphones with a single-camera setup can still compete. Google’s Pixel 3 is regarded by many as having the overall best smartphone camera because it produces well-balanced colors and clean cutouts on portrait mode. Apple’s iPhone XR has almost the same camera setup and features as the more expensive XS and XS Max, including the TrueDepth camera in front.


In this comparison, we pit the two against each other to find out which smartphone you think takes better photos. This is once again a blind test so get your pen and paper ready! Do note that all photos were taken on Auto or Portrait mode (when applicable) and have only been resized for faster loading times. They are labeled Photo A and Photo B randomly. Swipe left to see the photos in full and take note of your picks!

#15

Photo B: iPhone XR


There’s no clear winner in this shootout; both phones did a great job in capturing images even in low-light scenarios. Choosing which one is better boils down to preference.


The Pixel 3 produces photos with higher contrast and sharpness, which sometimes turn out darker so photos tend to look more dramatic than they are in real life. The iPhone XR, with its Smart HDR technology, balances out highlights and shadows really well, so much so that backlit images look like they have more than one light source.


In the portrait mode department, neither of the phones did a perfect job — how the cutouts turn out varies depending on the hair’s texture, how busy the background is, and even lighting.


When it comes to selfies, the Pixel 3 offers a wider field of view, an option to switch to a secondary wide-angle lens, as well as a feature called Night Sight that’s also available on its rear camera. One complaint we’ve always had with iPhones is how tight selfies are as seen in sets #13 and #14, although the iPhone XR selfies look more pleasing compared to those taken with the Pixel 3, where my skin tone tends to look more dull.
