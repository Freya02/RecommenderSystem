  * An Italian tech blog published a video of the Huawei P20 Lite getting unboxed.
  * This leak comes almost two weeks out from the official launch of the P20 line on March 27, leaving little to the imagination.
  * Alleged final specs for the P20 Lite are included as well.

The Huawei P20, P20 Pro, and P20 Lite will be officially revealed on March 27 in Paris. However, almost two weeks ahead of that event, we have an unboxing video of the Huawei P20 Lite via Italian tech blog HDBlog.it.


In the video below, Niccolò Roli takes us through an unboxing of the Huawei P20 Lite, as well as a quick run through of turning on the device and playing around with some of its features:


As expected, the P20 Lite (and the other two phones in the P20 series) look a lot like the iPhone X, complete with a notch at the top of the display. There’s a fingerprint sensor on the back of the P20 Lite, whereas the P20 and P20 Pro are likely to feature the sensor on the front.


This leaked unboxing video shows that a lot of the rumors behind the P20 Lite are correct, which of course leads us to believe that the rumors in our rumor roundup article of the P20 series are likely to be true as well. However, we won’t know anything for certain until March 27.


Here are the P20 Lite specs, according to HDBlog.it:
