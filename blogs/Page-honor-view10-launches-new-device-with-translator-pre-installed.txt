Microsoft Translator has partnered with Honor – a sub-brand of Huawei – to bring AI-powered offline neural network translation to a larger market. The new Honor View10 comes with an optimized Microsoft Translator app pre-installed.


Similarly to the Huawei Mate 10 series, the Honor View10 also features a Neural-Network Processing Unit (NPU), which allows the Microsoft Translator app to deliver neural translations with or without an internet connection.
