China’s top smartphone brand Oppo will be releasing an entry-level device with a dual camera setup and powerful battery.


Dubbed as Oppo A3s, the smartphone’s specs have been revealed, based on GSMarena’s latest leak.


It boasts a 6.2-inch HD+ display, with 1520 by 720 pixels. For its cameras, the device has a duyal rear camera composed of 13-megapixel and 2-megapixel sensors. Its selfie shooter has 8-megapixels sensors.
