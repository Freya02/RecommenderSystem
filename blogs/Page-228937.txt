Lenovo K8 Plus with 5.2-inch 1080p display, dual rear cameras launched in India for Rs. 10999



Lenovo today launched K8 Plus, the company’s latest mid-range smartphone in the ‘K series’ in India, soon after the launch of K8 Note in the country, as it had promised.

Similar to the K8 Note, it has a 13-megapixel rear camera with dual-tone LED flash along with a secondary 5-megapixel camera to capture depth information for bokeh effect.


It has a unibody metal design, features dedicated dual SIM and microSD slots arranged in a single tray instead of separate trays in the K8 Note. It also has a dedicated hardware Music key to play or pause music that can also be customized to launch any other app along with Lenovo’s usual Theatermax tech and Dolby Atmos. It packs a 4000mAh battery that promises up to 2 days of battery life and comes with 10W rapid charger.
