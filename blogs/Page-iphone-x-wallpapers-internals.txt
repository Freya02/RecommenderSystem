Show Off the Inside of Your iPhone X with These Wallpapers


written by Julia Bluff


We‚Äôve just finished up with our iPhone X teardown (and what a teardown it was)‚Äîwhich means there‚Äôs only one item left on our teardown check-list: iPhone X wallpapers.


Every year, we cap off our teardown extravaganza by releasing wallpapers that show off the sweet internals of your iPhone. Apple spent too much effort on the iPhone X‚Äôs hardware to cover it up with glass that you can‚Äôt even see through. If you‚Äôre not interested in peeling up the OLED screen with a Suction Handle, like we do, then a wallpaper of your iPhone X internals is the next-best, less-destructive thing.


With these sweet wallpapers, you can basically pretend you‚Äôre looking straight through the screen and into the heart of your phone‚Äîlike you have X-ray vision. And speaking of X-rays‚Äîthis year, we have two internals options for you: a gorgeous, high-resolution image and an X-ray image of your iPhone X insides. By the way, the edge-to-edge display makes this set of wallpapers especially slick.


Here‚Äôs how you get yours:


For best results, navigate to this blog post on your phone. Find the image you want as your wallpaper and click on the photo for the full resolution. Then, save the image on to your phone. You can set the wallpaper from ‚ÄúWallpapers‚Äù in your phone‚Äôs Settings‚Äî‚ÄúChoose a New Wallpaper‚Äù lists your recent photos, including downloads.


Both ‚ÄúStill‚Äù and ‚ÄúPerspective‚Äù work, but I like ‚ÄúStill‚Äù a little more.


Click the photos below for the full resolution image.

iPhone X ‚Ä¶ X-ray wallpaper:


Click photo for full resolution image: (1125 x 2432)


Full props to our friends at Creative Electron for the amazing X-ray shot! We‚Äôre still working on wallpapers for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus (stay tuned for those). We‚Äôve also added brand-new iPhone 8 and 8 Plus internals wallpapers. And you can find wallpapers for your iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, as well as the 5s/5c and iPhone 5 on our blog.


If all these wallpapers have got you wondering what those bits and bobs inside your iPhone X actually do, then check out our video teardown:

25. walds11 November 9, 2017 at 2:49 am
    Wow, these wallpapers are amazing. Why do they seem zoomed in after I set as wallpaper on my iPhone X?

26. Sean November 9, 2017 at 6:06 am

    Fantastic!

    Please also for iPhone 6 Plus.
    Thanks
    Bryce

29. Eric November 9, 2017 at 7:49 am
    Not sure what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I‚Äôm on an iPhone X and can‚Äôt download/save the photos. Not on chrome or safari. Any suggestions? I know to press and hold but it isn‚Äôt doing anything.

30. Julia Bluff November 9, 2017 at 9:32 am
    Hey @Eric, try pressing the little forward icon/button when you have the full image. It should give you an option to save the image to your phone.

31. Julia Bluff November 9, 2017 at 9:33 am
    We have those already, @Bryce. Scroll down and click on the links under the X-ray image.

32. kadyuu November 9, 2017 at 9:33 am
    iPhone SE please

33. Julia Bluff November 9, 2017 at 9:34 am
    Hi @walds11 ‚Äî did you try ‚ÄúStill‚Äù view? Might just be me, but I thought ‚ÄúStill‚Äù had a better view than ‚ÄúPerspective‚Äù.

34. Julia Bluff November 9, 2017 at 9:37 am
    Hi @Sander, we did them for the iPad 3, but we haven‚Äôt done wallpapers for the iPad since. Mostly because it‚Äôs all battery under there, so it‚Äôs not nearly as interesting as the iPhone internals. But I‚Äôll pass along your request to our teardown team!

35. Julia Bluff November 9, 2017 at 9:38 am
    Hi @Ankur, iPhone 6s Wallpapers are linked at the bottom of the post, under the X-ray image.

36. Erik November 9, 2017 at 9:43 am
    I second for the Pixel 2 XL, this is such an awesome idea and looks freaking great.

37. Rocco November 9, 2017 at 10:24 am
    Well done!

38. Donedward November 9, 2017 at 12:09 pm
    Bring note 8

39. Leon Heess November 9, 2017 at 12:16 pm
    I need one for the OnePlus 3T

40. Marco November 9, 2017 at 12:19 pm
    Please do this for all phones in the future‚Ä¶

    Would like to see it for the Samsung S7. ‚òπÔ∏è

41. Julia Bluff November 9, 2017 at 12:58 pm
    Hi @Marco, most Samsung phones and lots of Android phones in general open from the back and have everything attached to the back of the screen, making them poor candidates for this sort of photo. They‚Äôre not *true* straight-through-the-screen images‚Äîso we usually skip them. We could do it with X-ray images‚Äìbut we don‚Äôt have one of those machines from Creative Electron in-house.

42. Bennie November 9, 2017 at 3:46 pm
    Lg stylo 2 s plz

43. Balthazar November 9, 2017 at 3:47 pm
    You lost 4pixel in your Wallpaper (2432 vs 2436)

49. G√ºlen November 10, 2017 at 12:20 am
    Please similar walpaper for iPhone 7 üôè

50. V.Lindvall November 10, 2017 at 1:32 am
    This isnt even ‚ÄúXray‚Äù the image is how the phone looks like without the glass back, not how it is if the screen was see-through. So just so you all know, this isnt an xray image, this is just a picture of the inside from the back.

    NOT how the phone would look if the screen was see-through

51. DC November 10, 2017 at 1:48 am
    Think I‚Äôd very much like this for my {nearly arrived} Pixel 2 XL. Pleeasseeee!

52. Brandon November 10, 2017 at 4:30 am
    It is on Your X Wallpapers app. Search it on AppStore. Try it.

53. Julia Bluff November 10, 2017 at 8:33 am
    Hi @V.Lindvall, the iPhone X Wallpapers are the view under the screen‚Äîthat‚Äôs how modern iPhones open, as you can see here in our teardown.

54. Trancerapid November 10, 2017 at 11:51 am
    Rule geometries, such as unobtrusive wallpaper are still the best wallpapers. The inner life would make me crazy after a week. Too restless.

55. Chunker November 10, 2017 at 4:34 pm
    Wow‚Ä¶talk about not knowing what you don‚Äôt know. I love this idea! I would love one for the iPhone 8 Plus. I‚Äôll use the 7 plus version for now‚Ä¶=)

56. Èô≥ÊñáÂÆâ November 10, 2017 at 5:45 pm
    I need this for Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact. Thanks.

61. Juan Diego Villamil November 12, 2017 at 8:20 am
    Hiii! It would also be great if you did the same wallpaper with the iPhone 8!! Please do so

62. Frank Rivera November 12, 2017 at 12:18 pm
    Hey Julia , I‚Äôm having the same issue as Eric who stated that he‚Äôs unable to save the image when it‚Äôs in full size mode. I tried in both chrome and in safari but when I press down on the screen to prompt the option to save, nothing happens. Also using iPhone X

63. Idk November 12, 2017 at 4:52 pm

77. Strad November 19, 2017 at 2:17 pm
    @Julia Bluff: I downloaded iPhone X Wall image, the image displays fine, fully detailed. After selected as wall paper however, the edges of the image have been stretched out, left its iPhone‚Äôs metal frames and screws details outside of the view.

    can anyone advise how to modify the entire image into fit my iPhone X?

78. Strad November 20, 2017 at 7:06 pm
    update: I also love this iPhone X wallpaper very much, however the full view image is out of proportion when display on iPhone X‚Äôs screen, which means the image expends outside of my iPhone X‚Äôs display frame, we only get to view 80% of what‚Äôs in the image.


    Here is the fix: On your Photoshop, use the pixels that original image provided, create a layer on top and then shrink it down to 90%, voil√†!

79. J. Newell November 21, 2017 at 8:44 am
    Too funny. You guys are da best.

80. JJ November 22, 2017 at 1:36 pm

    What i don‚Äôt realize is in reality how you are no longer really much more well-preferred

    than you might be right now. You‚Äôre very intelligent. You
    know thus considerably on the subject of this matter,
    produced me in my view believe it from so many varied angles.
    Its like men and women are not fascinated unless it is something to accomplish with Woman gaga!


    Your personal stuffs nice. Always handle it up!

    Hey,


    thanks you for the great pictures. Do you also provide cropped wallpapers, so the outside frame isn‚Äôt in the picture and I don‚Äôt have to zoom in when making it as my background?
