Cinematic experience


Get in the scene


You'll feel fully immersed in what's on screen thanks to the Infinity Display's 18.5:9 ratio. The biggest display for Galaxy A phones to date, it offers a wide horizontal view, providing a stunning cinematic experience.


Screen


See it all at once


The Infinity Display is also longer than the screen on the previous model, so you can read and browse with less scrolling. Whether checking your social media or reading a news article, you'll see more at one time and give your thumbs a rest.


Camera


Masterpiece in a snap


Taking stunning photos on the Galaxy A8 and A8+ is as easy as tapping the shutter. The Dual Front Camera innovates selfies and wefies, putting the focus on you and your friends so you can capture moments in a new way. And with the rear 16MP camera, the surrounding scene will come out bright and clear, too.


Live Focus


Perfect your selfie


Add flair and fun to your selfies with Live Focus mode on the Dual Front Camera. It blurs the background, adding bokeh so you and your friends stand out. Afterwards, you can readjust the focus to your taste. And by enabling Beauty effect before taking the photo, selfies and wefies come out stunning.


Filter & effect


Focus on the fun


Customize your pictures with exciting stickers and filters. Decorate selfies with stickers using face-recognition technology. Or edit before you shoot with Food mode, Beauty effect, or Filters. And Beauty effect works while taking a video with the front camera, so you can look your best in action.

A smart way to search


Easily find the image you want with the gallery search bar. As you search, the gallery analyzes your photos and pulls out relevant pictures, even displaying them by category.

**The Galaxy A8 and A8+'s IP68 rating does not protect against heavy rain and significant splashes.
