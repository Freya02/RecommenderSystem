Xiaomi Pocophone F2 vs. Xiaomi Pocophone F1: leaks on specs, upgrades and price


By GB Blog Official 2018-12-08 5307 1

Ever since the Pocophone F1 was released by Xiaomi’s new sub-brand POCO, users have been wondering and speculating whether there will be a sequel to the popular model. Today, we already know that the Pocophone F2 is coming (probably even paired with the Pocophone F2 Plus). What we don’t know is pretty much everything else: there is no official information out yet regarding the upcoming phone’s specs and design. But then there are leaks, for which we are very thankful — as they give us a sneak peak into what to expect from this exciting release.
                Xiaomi Pocophone F1 4G Phablet Global Version 6GB RAM - GRAPHITE BLACK 
$424.75 $329.99 (288 reviews)                                                         

Xiaomi Pocophone F2 vs. Xiaomi Pocophone F1: larger display and higher resolution



The Pocophone F1 sports a 6.18 inch display with 2246 x 1080 FHD resolution and 18.7:9 aspect ratio. As for the Pocophone F2, the rumors reveal that one of the upgrades will be a bigger screen — 6.3 or 6.4 inches with 19.5:9 aspect ratio. It's also expected to have a high resolution of 2280x1080 pixels.






Xiaomi Pocophone F2 vs. Xiaomi Pocophone F1: sleeker design with a teardrop notch



Some speculate that the Pocophone F2 will come with a smaller notch than the one on the Pocophone F1 and that it will be a teardrop notch. Other believe that if Xiaomi drop the idea of having a Face ID on the phone, the notch may disappear altogether. Not much is known when it comes to the phone's dimensions or build — but we do expect the Poco F2 to keep in line with the budget smartphone standards — so, we probably should not be expecting prime materials or any special design features.






Pocophone F2 vs. Pocophone F1 CPU upgrade: from Snapdragon 845 to Snapdragon 8150



The Pocophone F1 owes a lot of its fame and popularity to the powerful Snapdragon 845 processor — and its title of being "the cheapest smartphone with the Snapdragon 845" has definitely made it an instant hit. We would thus expect most users to be perfectly fine with the Poco 2 keeping the same CPU. However, it is most likely that there will be an upgrade to the processor. Initially, it was rumored that the Poco F2 would be coming with the Snapdragon 855 — but now the word is that it will be the Snapdragon 8150 instead. Keeping in mind that the Poco 2 is a budget phone, a CPU upgrade is definitely a strong selling point.



Pocophone F2 vs. Pocophone F1: more RAM & ROM options


The Poco F1 comes in two configurations: 6GB + 64GB and 6GB + 128GB. The Poco 2 will probably come with the same popular setup of 6GB + 64GB. There is also talk of more upscale versions as well: 6GB + 128GB and 8GB + 128GB.



Pocophone F2 vs. Pocophone F1: maybe triple cameras


The Pocophone F1 comes with the 12.0MP + 5.0MP cameras on the rear panel — nothing to get to excited about. But the phone saves its a-game for the selfie cam — an impressive 20MP with AI Beautify Mode.






As for the cameras on the Poco F2, there is still a lot of mystery. A lot of users still rely on the concept video of the phone leaked a couple of months back that hints at the Poco F2 actually coming with three rear cameras. However, this is working against the phone being a budget smartphone — having a triple cam setup is definitely a costly endeavour. This is why some believe that it's much more likely for the Poco F2 to come with a smaller upgrade on the camera side: 16MP + 5MP rear camera. The 20MP selfie shooter is expected to be here to stay.



Pocophone F2 vs. Pocophone F1: more battery power


The Pocophone F1 manages to pack in a pretty large battery — 4000mAh, which is good for 30 hours of calling and 146 hours of audio playback. The Pocophone F2 may be sporting a significantly larger battery — as large as 5000mAh. However, there are also rumours that the improvement in the battery department may not be so significant and the Poco F2 will come with a 4300mAh battery (or, perhaps, even 4100mAh). Quick charge support should not be going anywhere.



Pocophone F2 vs. Pocophone F1: side by side


While a lot of the above mentioned specifications come from leak-inspired rumours, we are still starting to get a better idea of what the Poco F2 will be like. Let's look at the potential improvements side by side with the Pocophone F1.


          Xiaomi Pocophone F1      Xiaomi Pocophone F2     
Display   6.18 inches; 2246 x 1080 6.4 inches; 2280x1080   
CPU       Snapdragon 845           Snapdragon 8150         
RAM + ROM 6GB + 64GB/128GB         6GB/8GB + 64GB/128GB    
Cameras   12.0MP + 5.0MP; 20 MP    45MP or 16MP + 5MP; 20MP
Battery   4000mAh                  5000mAh/4300mAh/4100mAh 


Price-wise, there is a lot of speculation as well. With the Poco F1 going for $329.99 (64GB) and $359.99 (128GB), it is expected that the Poco F2 will not be much more expensive with the potential price tag being under $400.



While the rumours and speculations amount, we still have to wait for quite a bit before we see the Poco F2 in the flesh. In the meantime, the Poco F1 remains to be "the most high-end budget smartphone". Whether this title will get taken away by the Poco F2...we'll have to wait and see.
