Honor 7C Smartphone Review
Florian Wimmer, üëÅ Daniel Schmidt, ‚úì Stefanie Voigt (translated by Ariana Brodsky), 06/13/2018
Touchscreen Smartphone Phablet ARM Android

The letters make all the difference. The Honor 7C is a lower mid-range smartphone in large format with a modern full-view display. Unfortunately, the dual camera's second sensor has a very low resolution. Can we take that hit in exchange for this low price?

Honor's 7 series has recently expanded somewhat: For a start, there is now the Honor 7A, the cheapest device in the series, with a simple camera and a 5.7-inch screen. The Honor 7X is significantly larger and equipped with a MP dual camera. With its high resolution and ample storage space, it is currently the top model in the series. The Honor 7C - our test device - falls between the other two smartphones, solidly in the lower mid-range price bracket. And indeed, its specifications also position it right between the other devices in the series: It has a dual camera, but the second sensor's lens has a rather low resolution. The display resolution and storage space are also appropriate to the price tag of 180 Euros (~$210; similar cost in the US). Incidentally, the Honor 7C is the successor of the Honor 6C.


For the purposes of this review, we will compare the Honor 7C with the Motorola Moto G6 Play, the Huawei Y7 2018 and the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus.

Case - Stable metal back on the Honor 7C


Honor has opted to outfit the 7C with a modern 2:1 display that looks fashionable, despite its lower mid-range price tag. The panel has narrow side borders and somewhat wider borders at the top and bottom. On the company website, Honor refers only to the smartphone's "metal design", but the material on the back is truly metal. The front is equipped with 2.5D glass that is shielded with a solid protective film. The transition is clearly visible, but the screen is still well-protected.


At 164 grams (0.36 lbs), the Honor 7C is quite a lightweight smartphone, yet it feels good in the hand. The back gives way slightly under pressure, which detracts from the smartphone's otherwise sturdy quality. Fortunately, the pressure does not reach the screen, and the front of the smartphone is quite stable. It can hardly be pressed in or twisted at all and makes no cracking noises under pressure.

Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus Honor 7C Huawei Y7 2018 Huawei Honor 7X Motorola Moto G6 Play

Connectivity - Features typical of this price bracket


With 32 GB of storage and 3 GB of RAM, the Honor 7C positions itself in between similarly-priced devices: The competitor from the same manufacturer, the Huawei Y7 2018, only offers 16 GB/2 GB, while the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus is equipped with 64 GB of storage space and 4 GB of RAM. Overall, the Honor 7C's connectivity is fitting for its price class. It has no unusual connections, just a USB 2.0 port and the usual Bluetooth 4.2. Honor is actively advertising the dual Bluetooth function, which allows two Bluetooth devices to be connected with the smartphone simultaneously.


Software - Pre-installed apps are a blessing and a curse


Honor's parent company, Huawei, is known for selling smartphones with a large number of pre-installed apps. That has both advantages and disadvantages: Some useful tools, such as a proprietary backup system and a design app for customizing the layout of the user interface, are nice additions. But the smartphone also arrives with advertising apps and Free2Play games that are just a waste of space for most users. Fortunately, most apps can be easily deleted.


Android 8, overlaid with Huawei's EMUI, serves as the device's operating system. The security patches at the time of review date from April 2018 and are thus reasonably current.


Communication and GPS - Slow WLAN, precise GPS


The fact that the Honor 7C does not support 5 GHz WLAN is a shame, but not unusual in this price bracket. Among our comparison devices, only the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus offers the lesser-used frequency. In our benchmark with the Linksys EA8500 reference router, the smartphone lands in the lower-average range compared to the other devices. Even so, it is nearly as fast as the more expensive Honor 7X.


The smartphone supports 7 LTE bands, which should be sufficient for trips within Europe. Travelers to far-off destinations, however, may find that the Honor 7C cannot access the network.

GPS test indoors


GPS test outdoors


Indoors, the Honor 7C's GPS module cannot determine its location; but as soon as the smartphone is taken outdoors, it immediately positions itself and is accurate to 3 meters (~10 feet).


In order to test the smartphone's positioning abilities in everyday use, we took it on a bike ride along with our professional navigation device, the Garmin Edge 500. Both devices reproduced the route well, though the Garmin device was a little more precise. For non-professional use without higher expectations, the Honor 7C should be a perfectly sufficient companion.

Phone Function and Call Quality - The Honor 7C has good voice quality


The telephone app on the Huawei Honor 7C looks somewhat different from the respective app on devices with Vanilla Android, but it functions quite similarly: It displays a tab with the telephone pad and received/missed/dialed calls. The user can also access their contacts and favorites directly from the tab.

At maximum volume, the voice quality is mediocre. The speaker readily distorts the voice at the other end of the call and produces an irritating buzzing sound. However, if the volume is dialed down somewhat, the conversation partner's voice feels quite near. The user's voice is transmitted cleanly. In calls over the speakerphone, the person at the other end is still easy to understand. But the user must take care to speak loud enough, as the microphone fails to pick up quiet voices.


Cameras - The Huawei Honor 7C offers (almost) a dual camera


shot taken with front camera

The Honor 7C comes with a dual camera, but this should by no means be taken to refer to two independent lenses. Independent lenses perform tricks such as optical zoom, whereas this is simply a 13 MP main lens and a 2 MP secondary lens for depth of field effects. Even so, the Honor 7C outdoes the competition here, given that all of the comparison devices in this price bracket only offer a single camera.


Photos taken in normal lighting look quite bright and also quite sharp. However, bright areas bloom easily and lose their definition. In dark environments, the camera cannot be used without the flash. The images lack light and are quite blurry.


Videos can be recorded in Full HD at 30 FPS. Both the image sharpness and the color reproduction are reasonably good, and details are rendered quite clearly.


The front camera has a resolution of 8 MP and takes pictures that are somewhat lacking in color. Bright areas bloom easily here too. However, as with the back camera, we are satisfied with its image sharpness.

In the regulated lighting conditions in our laboratory, the main camera performs well in terms of image sharpness, but more contrast certainly would not hurt. The edges exhibit a minimal amount of colored fringe, and the solid areas are not quite clean; but for a smartphone camera in this price range, it carries out its task quite well. The color reproduction, however, is clearly too pale.

Accessories and Warranty - Only the basic necessities


The packaging contains nothing more than a power supply, a USB cable, a SIM tool and the usual leaflets. Accessories specifically designed for the device are not available in the Huawei or the Honor online shop.


The Honor 7C comes with a 24-month warranty in the EU.


Input Devices and Operation - Smooth input recognition despite protective film


Swift Key serves as the smartphone's keyboard app; other keyboard apps must be installed manually. But typing goes quickly with Swift Key, and it offers a host of customization options.


Fingers glide smoothly over the protective film on the touchscreen. The smartphone recognizes input flawlessly, whether in the middle of the screen, along the edges or in the corners.


A simple mode with fewer symbols allows the user to activate the smartphone's basic functions. The navigation bar, as an alternative to the menu buttons located at the bottom edge of the screen, is also available for those who prefer it.

Display - Not exactly bright and lacks contrast


subpixel grid

1440x720 pixels is a perfectly normal resolution in this price bracket, but the Honor 7C's large display demands a higher resolution to look 100% sharp. The manufacturer justifies the Honor 7X's higher price with its somewhat higher resolution, but the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus offers more pixels too.


At 403 cd/m¬≤, the smartphone's average brightness is mediocre, although the Huawei Y7 2018 is even darker. In addition, the similarity of brightness distribution across the screen is just 85%. Differences in brightness are definitely visible in larger monochromatic areas.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation)

‚Ñπ
To dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) . This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.
Screen flickering / PWM detected                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3086 Hz ‚â§ 26 % brightness setting 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The display backlight flickers at 3086 Hz (Likely utilizing PWM) Flickering detected at a brightness setting of 26 % and below. There should be no flickering or PWM above this brightness setting.   The frequency of 3086 Hz is quite high, so most users sensitive to PWM should not notice any flickering.   In comparison: 52 % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 9173 (minimum: 43 - maximum: 142900) Hz was measured.

The display's black value of 0.61 cd/m¬≤ also fails to impress. 643:1 is not a strong contrast ratio either. As a result, the colors on the display look fairly pallid. The color temperature can be freely adjusted in the menu settings, or the user can simply use the warm and cold presets.


We use a spectrophotometer and the CalMAN software to determine a display's color accuracy. Here we found that the panel does not suffer from a blue cast, and its average color accuracy is also acceptable.


We also established that the screen flickers at a high frequency. Fortunately, this means that even sensitive individuals should not have to worry about eye problems or headaches.

Display Response Times

Display response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.

Outdoors, low display brightness comes up against the added problem of surface reflections. The screen content is still somewhat visible in the shade, but in brighter environments it is almost entirely obscured.


In principle, the IPS display is readable even from flat angles, but the brightness level varies noticeably.

Performance - High performance thanks to Qualcomm


The SoC at work in the Honor 7C is almost unusual for a Huawei smartphone: Because Huawei engineers its own SoCs, typically it uses those chips. But in this case we have Qualcomm's Snapdragon 450, at least in the version sold in the West.


The Snapdragon 450 is certainly a good choice, given that its eight cores and up to 1.8 GHz provide more performance than usual for this price bracket. In the benchmarks, the Honor 7C clearly outperforms the Huawei Y7 2018, and even the significantly more expensive Honor 7X cannot get far ahead. An Adreno 506 serves as the smartphone's graphics unit. This part of the SoC also brings considerably more performance power than other devices in this price range. Only the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus is faster in terms of graphics.

The speed of the Huawei Honor 7C's internal storage medium is mediocre: The Huawei Y7 2018 is outpaced here too, but most of the other devices are able to access data more quickly.

We use a Toshiba Exceria Pro M501 as a reference card to test how fast a smartphone can access a microSD card. The Honor 7C's results are typical of its price class here. On the subject of the microSD slot: Interestingly, Honor has opted to equip the smartphone with 2 SIM card slots as well as a separate microSD slot, enabling the user to utilize all three at once. MicroSD cards are always treated as external memory, and the storage space can be used for apps.

Games - OK for fairly lightweight games


Simple games like ‚ÄúAngry Birds‚Äù are no problem for the Honor 7C, and somewhat more demanding 3D games, ‚ÄúTemple Run 2‚Äù, for example, also run flawlessly. The screen's low resolution is certainly a benefit here.


There is no lag in the smartphone's reaction to input via the position sensor or touchscreen.

Emissions - Remains cool, reasonably good speaker


The temperatures in idle mode and under load are almost identical. In both modes, the lower portion of the front warms up the most. This is hardly noticeable, however, as the smartphone always maintains a comfortable temperature.

speaker test "pink noise"

A small mono speaker on the bottom edge of the device is responsible for sound production, and it does a reasonably good job. At a maximum of 87.3 dB(A), it can get quite loud‚Äîand even at maximum volume, the sound is still relatively clear. It does not hold a candle to a stereo, of course, but the sound is quite good for a device in this price bracket.


Speakers or headphones can be plugged into the 3.5mm jack, and the resulting sound is clean in both cases.

Battery Life


The Honor 7C's efficient use of energy is apparent in its battery life: The smartphone lasted a good 11:33 hours in our WLAN test. This run time is especially good considering that the Honor 7C's battery capacity is only 3000 mAh. The Huawei Y7 2018 is equipped with the same size battery, yet our test device runs more than an hour longer.


The Honor 7C's energy usage is modest in everyday use as well: The battery should easily last through a workday, even if the device is continuously in use. The smartphone should also run through the subsequent evening without any battery issues; when used sparingly, the device could even go two days between charges. But charging the smartphone with the charger included in the box does take over two hours, not exactly a speedy process.

Verdict - The Honor 7C is worth the price


In Review: the Honor 7C. Test device courtesy of notebooksbilliger.de.

Both in online forums and among expert groups, time and again people ask whether Huawei is creating its own competition with its Honor brand. The question is legitimate, given that the Honor 7C is in no way inferior to the similarly equipped, and slightly more expensive, Huawei Y7 2018. On the contrary: The Honor model has more performance power, better battery life and a dual camera (though in the latter case, the second lens only supports the main lens and cannot be used independently).


Even at this low price point, the display is too dark and lacking in contrast, and the storage access could stand to be faster. But those are the only points of criticism we have for the Honor 7C. Even the significantly more expensive Honor 7X sometimes has a hard time competing with its supposedly weaker brother.


Lots of performance at a low cost, a reasonably good camera and a metal case‚Äîthe 7C poses a challenge for more than just the in-house competition.


The Qualcomm SoC seems to have been a lucky choice, seeing as it gives the Honor 7C a fighting chance against its rivals from other manufacturers as well. Its good price-performance ratio makes it a great bargain.
