OPPO F9 Pro Hands On and Photo Gallery



After a considerable gap, OPPO launched F9 Pro smartphone in the Indian market at an event in Mumbai yesterday . The OPPO F9 Pro comes with a waterdrop-shaped display notch, updated camera features, and of course the company’s proprietary VOOC flash charging support.


This time,OPPO has concentrated more on design bringing unique looks to the mid-range smartphone. It has a gradient color design, again a first in the F series, which uses advanced color processes.


To achieve a unified design, F9 Pro for the first time has used the same gradient design on the side frame as well, making the sides and the back a naturally connected whole.


The OPPO F9 Pro sports a 6.3-inch FHD+ display with a screen-to-body ration of 90.8 percent. Having said that, it has little to no bezel the sides, thereby maintaining the comfortable size one-handed operation.


Talking about the placement, the OPPO F9 Pro has volume buttons, dedicated memory and dual SIM slot on the left, while the power button is placed on the right side. The 3.5mm audio jack, micro USB port, and speaker grille sit on the bottom of the device.


Turning back, the rear side consists of a dual camera setup that protrudes a little. On the sheet, it has a 16MP primary rear camera and secondary 2MP camera with LED flash. The front side is taken care of 25-megapixel camera that can use OPPO’s AI Beauty 2.1 feature and live filters.


It is powered by 3500mAh battery with the support for VOOC Flash charge fast charging that promises 2 hours of talk time with 5-minute charge. This device is shipped with ColorOS 5.2 based on Android 8.1 (Oreo).


One of the notable features in the ColorOS 5.2 is the Smart Bar. It slides out from the right edge of the display. It has shortcut icons for the camera, taking a screenshot, and your most frequently used apps.


The OPPO F9 Pro is powered by the Octa-Core MediaTek Helio P60 SoC under the hood with ARM Mali-G72 MP3 GPU and 6GB of RAM. It has 64GB of internal storage.


The OPPO F9 Pro is now up for pre-order via Flipkart at Rs. 23,990 and will go on sale offline and online from August 31st.
