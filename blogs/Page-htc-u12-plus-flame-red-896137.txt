  * The HTC U12 Plus comes in a Flame Red color and is available now at HTC.com for a September 10 ship date.

  * The Flame Red variant was previously only available in certain countries but is now available in the United States and Canada.
  * The HTC U12 Plus Flame Red edition is the same device that launched in May as far as specs are concerned.

If you live in the United States or Canada and were previously disappointed that you couldn’t get your hands on the HTC U12 Plus Flame Red edition, your prayers are answered. HTC just made the Flame Red version available to North America at HTC.com.

HTC U12 Plus review: You should probably pass

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-rMCtLsOcg The HTC U11 surprised us last year with its superb camera and snappy software, and the HTC U12 Plus continues that trend. The company's new 2018 flagship offers a near-complete package likely to impress HTC enthusiasts …

The HTC U12 Plus launched in Ceramic Black, Titanium Black, Translucent Blue, and Flame Red. But since the Flame Red version was only available in limited places, North Americans were stuck between either black or blue colors.


The HTC U12 Plus Flame Red edition changes tones depending on the light. In the photo below, it looks like a very striking red:


However, in our hands-on with the device the light made it looks more purplish-pink than red:


It’s also worth pointing out that the Flame Red edition doesn’t have a translucent look to it like the blue does.


You can pre-order an HTC U12 Plus Flame Red edition at HTC.com by clicking the button below. The device will cost $800 and is exclusively available in the 64GB version in either unlocked, Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile variants.
