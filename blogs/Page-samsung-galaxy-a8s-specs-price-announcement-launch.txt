Samsung will announce the Galaxy A8s on December 10


It’s going to be Samsung vs Huawei this month

* Samsung is not letting Huawei take the crown. The race to the first holed smartphone is reaching the peak, and it looks the South Korean company is eager to launch the Galaxy A8s ahead of its competitors.


The notch, which has received mixed reactions, might have to start saying goodbye. Mark your calendars for December 10 because it’ll be a historic day in the smartphone industry. The Galaxy A8s will be the first official smartphone to have a selfie camera within the display.


Based on previous leaks, the Galaxy A8s will have an LCD made by a company named BOE. Rumors have it that Huawei is in partnership with the same manufacturer, but Samsung will have the more premium panel.


Nothing is confirmed yet, but specs-wise we’re expecting the new Samsung phone to sport a 6.3-inch display with a Full HD+ resolution, Snapdragon 710 chipset, up to 6GB of memory, and a 24-megapixel selfie camera embedded into the display.


Like with the Galaxy A7, the Galaxy A8s will have triple rear cameras. The configuration is most likely similar with a high-resolution main camera accompanied by an ultra-wide shooter and a depth sensor.


Price and availability details are anticipated to be announced during the event. Stay tuned!

Google I/O 2019 is set for May 7 to 9


Announced by the head honcho himself

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has officially announced the date and venue for Google I/O 2019: May 7 to 9 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. There we’ll likely see loads of software developments and updates from the search giant.


It was around the same time last year when the 2018 edition of the multi-day event happened. If it’s anything like before, Google I/O 2019 will introduce a bunch of apps and services that fit their ecosystem.


More importantly, it might be the stage wherein we’ll see more of Android Q, the next version of Google’s mobile operating system.


Glad the transmission was received:) See you at Shoreline Amphitheatre May 7-9 for this year’s I/O! #io19 pic.twitter.com/CXWpQR4Eza

Although it’s unlikely that Google will provide us with a name or final working build for Android Q by then, they might provide a taste of what the beta version has to offer.


From what we’ve gathered so far, Android Q aims to have a system-wide dark interface to save on battery life and reduce eye strain. It’ll also have stricter control over app permissions, plus a desktop mode if leaks hold true.


There are a little over three months to go, but don’t worry, we’ll be busy with the Galaxy S10 launch, Mobile World Congress 2019, and more before that happens.

Facebook will combine Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp


Will come with new encryption

Outside of Facebook, the world’s most famous apps are Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Unsurprisingly, Mark Zuckerberg owns all three. While the Facebook founder has already dominated social media, he is far from done.


Based on sources close to Facebook, Zuckerberg will integrate these three apps into one ecosystem in the future. While all three will remain their own app, they will gain the ability to communicate with one another seamlessly. In other words, Instagram users can talk to both Messenger users and WhatsApp users in the same app. The same goes for the other two apps.


The integration will simplify Facebook’s ecosystem, creating a bridge between messaging apps. Throughout the past few years, Facebook acquired Instagram and WhatsApp. In 2014, the company created its own app, Messenger, spinning off from Facebook’s chat function. All three apps now share 2.6 billion users between them.


Of course, Facebook hasn’t been the paragon of cybersecurity lately. The company has consistently misused data for suspicious intentions. Data security might escalate into a bigger issue upon integration.


To address this, the integration will come with end-to-end encryption. The apps’ messages will remain confidential between participants. The move will increase security against outside interference. However, the question remains: Will Facebook keep the data safe against its clients?


Luckily, Facebook will not rush these issues before launching the integration. According to the report, the company will need thousands of workers on the project. Zuckerberg hopes for completion by late 2019 to early 2020.

PUBG Lite launches to better compete against Fortnite


Published

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, is finally launching a free version that’s first appearing in Thailand. It’s simply called PUBG Lite.


The PC-only game has lighter requirements, as well. Those with lower-end computers and no desire to shell out cash are the target market for this.


But what the developers really want to go after are players who either started with or switched over to Fortnite because that title’s battle royale mode has always been free for all platforms.


PC specs requirements for PUBG Lite


This isn’t to say that PUBG Lite is beginning the free-to-play model too late. The original PUBG raked in over one billion dollars in sales last year, making it one of the most profitable games of 2018.


Its developers must have been tempted to go cost-free, however. Fortnite‘s approach brought Epic Games around US$ 2.4 billion in 2018 — not bad for a game the relies heavily on in-app purchases.


There’s no word yet when or if PUBG Lite will come to more regions.
