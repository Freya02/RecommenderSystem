    Wow a phone....very much like many other phones.
    
    Why bother? All much of a muchness now. Reply

    * peevee - Tuesday, February 06, 2018 - link

      Nah, this one is specifically targeted at the morons. "updated software - making eyes pop and cheeks glow"... #beyourselfie... Reply

    * Amandtec - Tuesday, February 06, 2018 - link

      Price is very much UNLIKE other phones. Is it really worth it to pay 4x for a Sumsung or iPhone when the features they add don't make much difference to the average user compared to a Chinese phone like this? Of course, a lot of users want the brand halo as a status symbol...so they must pay... Reply

      * Cliff34 - Tuesday, February 06, 2018 - link

        Yes, this I agree. The price point for this phone is very attractive. It is comparable to any phone w/ SD625. We are living in the days where phones are going for 1,000+. A phone like this for average users and those who don't want to spend on the latest and greatest is a good deal. Reply

    * Wwhat - Thursday, February 08, 2018 - link

      It's cheap. it has a good resolution screen, it has 4 cameras enabling DoF and maybe stereoscopic view.
      Those are some things set it apart from others, some others are cheap but have a low res screen, or only one camera et cetera.
      
      Now if you are bored with the whole phone thing like many rightfully are you have the option to scroll to the next articles and save yourself the trouble of writing a comment stating the obvious, i.e.. that many people like you are bored with phones Reply

  * Hurr Durr - Tuesday, February 06, 2018 - link

    I find the "for the brave" slogan to be counterproductive when it is applied to the consumer mobile phone thing. Last thing I need from my communication device is to somehow challenge me. Reply

    * peevee - Tuesday, February 06, 2018 - link

      Well, if you phone makes your eyes pop, you need to be very brave... Reply

      * Holliday75 - Tuesday, February 06, 2018 - link

        Now I am worried about the glowing cheeks part. Reply

  * xype - Tuesday, February 06, 2018 - link

    Iâ€™m always amazed how companies with billions of dollars in cash canâ€™t afford a designer who knows not to put ultra thin white type on a bright turquoise background, or that it the same background might not be very helpful when trying to present new product colors like a bright grey and a shade of blue.

      You should see that presentation live first before commenting and not on some poorly shot, highly compressed fotos made with a mobile phone. Reply
