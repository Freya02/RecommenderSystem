Oppo F9 powered by MediaTek Helio P60




Aug 17, 2018 - 8:30 AM - Partners

The OPPO F9 is the latest designer smartphone to be powered by the MediaTek Helio P60. This 6.3-inch device features a huge 90.9% coverage display with tall 19.5:9 ratio and pin-sharp FullHD+ (2340 x 1080 pixel) resolution. The 'waterdrop' screen nestles an elegantly designed front-facing camera that can shoot 25MP selfies. Its sensor is packed with HDR and AI selfie enhancements, which are backed by the P60's multi-core AI processor.

As usual, OPPO's color and style is trend-setting, with a hue-changing gradient-effect and 'petal patterned' Sunrise Red, Twilight Blue and Starry Purple to choose from on the F9.


At the back, OPPO includes a dual-camera array - a first for its F series - with 16+2MP sensors that can capture beautiful photos with depth of field (bokeh) effects. The MediaTek Helio P60 silicon includes a triple-core ISP that's optimized for power efficiency plus other in-hardware engines such as the EIS, anti-blooming, RSC, CCU, Instant AE and much more. HDR specific handling enhancements include real-time HDR recording and viewing capacity, RAW-domain multi-frame HDR and Zig-Zag HDR.


The octa-core MediaTek Helio P60 features four powerful Arm Cortex-A73 plus four efficiency-focused Arm Cortex-A53 processors, and a fast Arm Mali-G73-based graphics engine. OPPO pairs this powerhouse to 4-6GB of fast LPDDR4x and 64GB of storage. The Android 8.1 OS has OPPO's popular ColorOS 5.2 atop, offering enhancements such as screen off music listening, AR camera object identification or the ability to specifically handle incoming social media messaging while gaming.


Meanwhile, OPPO's VOOC Flash Charge means a quick 5-minute battery boost gives 2 hours of talk-time. Its large 3,500mAh battery and smart management system actively learns your usage patterns, enabling you to be more productive.
