Available in China starting 12 December, these feature-packed smartphones bring full screen display innovations to the sub-RMB 1000 category


BEIJING, 7 December 2017 — Global technology leader Xiaomi today brought its full screen display innovations to the sub-RMB 1000 category with the release of two smartphones—Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus.


With beautifully designed 18:9 screens with rounded display corners, these two models are powered by Qualcomm’s 14nm eight-core processors. They sport large pixel (1.25μm) sensors for the main camera, front Selfie-light, as well as long-lasting batteries. Priced from RMB 999, both versions will go on sale starting 12 December.


18:9 display with rounded corners


With 5.7-inch and 5.99-inch 18:9 displays that take up almost the entire front surface, Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus provide a much larger viewing area compared with traditional 16:9 screen displays. This gives a better user experience whether users are reading news, editing spreadsheets, or playing games on a smartphone.


In addition, Redmi 5/Redmi 5 Plus have screens with rounded display corners and are designed with close attention to symmetry, delivering a stunning appearance. They also feature a four-sided curved design that gives users amazing hand-feel.


Large 1.25μm pixels and front LED Selfie-light for natural, well-exposed photos


Redmi 5/Redmi 5 Plus come with rear cameras sporting large 1.25μm-pixel sensors. The larger the pixels, the more light a sensor can capture, giving better image quality even in situations when lighting conditions are not perfect.


The front Selfie-light on Redmi 5/Redmi 5 Plus allows users to capture beautiful selfies even in low-light conditions. With an always-on mode, this also works when shooting videos. Combined with Xiaomi’s Beautify 3.0, Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus deliver flattering and natural selfies.


Long battery life and MIUI 9 enhancements


Battery life is one of the most important features on the Redmi series, and Redmi 5/Redmi 5 Plus continue this tradition with a built-in 3300/4000 mAh battery. The power-efficient 14nm Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets, coupled with enhancements in MIUI 9, give Redmi 5 Plus a standby time of up to 17 days.


Flagship-level testing standards


Xiaomi’s Redmi series is widely recognized for high quality, a result of various factors including the use of best-in-class suppliers, and extremely stringent reliability tests comparable to those used for flagship devices.


One example of Xiaomi’s dedication to introducing the highest quality features on all its devices is a design tailored to buffer the impact of any fall in the new Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus smartphones. With a reinforced structure, the likelihood of a broken screen is reduced in cases when a user drops the smartphone, landing corner first. Furthermore, enhancements to the earpiece, including an additional waterproof layer, help protect Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus from sweat and dust, reducing the likelihood of the call volume dropping over time.


Redmi 5 (2GB+16 GB) and Redmi 5 (3GB+32GB) will be available for RMB 799 and RMB 899 respectively. Redmi 5 Plus (3GB+32GB) will retail for RMB 999, and Redmi 5 Plus (4GB+64GB) for RMB 1299. They will be available in China on Mi.com, Mi Home stores, as well as Xiaomi’s flagship online stores on Tmall and JD.com starting 12 December.
