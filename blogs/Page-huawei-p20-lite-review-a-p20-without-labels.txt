Huawei P20 Lite Review: A P20 without labels


A Nova 2i disguising as a P20

Since the grand Huawei P20 series launch in Paris last March, the attention has been on the Huawei P20 Pro. Of course, the top dog gets the spotlight it deserves. Amidst the praises Huawei is getting, it seems like people are forgetting that there’s a shy midrange variant in the series. A variant that doesn’t have any camera branding and high price tag — the Huawei P20 Lite.


The P20 Lite joins the slew of new midrange phones to be released in the market. It follows in the footsteps of the Mate 10 Lite which is also known as the Nova 2i or Honor 9i in certain regions.


It has a 5.84-inch FullView display


With a 19:9 ratio and Full HD+ resolution


The infamous notch makes an appearance


It’s for the front camera, sensors, notification light, and earpiece


There’s a bit of a chin for the Huawei label


No fingerprint reader on the front


To the right are the physical keys


Short one for power, long one for volume


While on the left is the hybrid card slot


Either have a second SIM or a microSD card


There’s nothing to see up top…


Just the noise-canceling microphone


… because everything is down below


The audio port, USB-C, and loudspeaker all together as usual


The back definitely looks a Lite version of the P20


No Leica branding — just “Dual Lens”


The dual camera module protrudes outside


A nice touch but a bit prone to scratches


Common design of the P20 series


The trio of P20 devices from Huawei share a common design with just slight adjustments to distinguish each. For the P20 Lite, you can tell it apart due to the rear placement of the fingerprint reader and lack of Leica branding. This gives the P20 Lite the advantage of having a clean front with just the Huawei name sitting on the chin.


With a display measuring 5.84 inches (display sizes are getting very unusual lately) and bezel-less design, I find the P20 Lite easier to handle than other phones with a similar display size. The better ergonomics of the device can also be attributed to its rounded metal frame and smooth glass back. Compared to the Mate 10 Lite’s (or Nova 2i) all-metal design, the P20 Lite looks more stylish. If you don’t mind wiping off the smudges every now and then, the P20 Lite will appeal to you more.


The notch is not visible when the display is turned off, but there’s a way to hide it even during usage. In the settings, just head to the Notch menu under Display and you can choose to use the default setting that fully extends the screen’s real estate up to the notch (app compatibility varies, though) or just hide it. The upper portion will then just act like an extra display for notifications, system icons, date, and time.


Huawei has a clever trick that addresses my concern about notched displays. When in landscape orientation, the interface automatically eliminates the use of the pixels beside the notch. This will give you an unobstructed interface in any app, may it be games, video streaming, or even system apps like Settings or Gallery.


Performance is still the same


The P20 Lite is powered by the Kirin 659 — Huawei’s go-to home-baked processor for their midrange phones. It’s also the same processor found in the Mate 10 Lite (or Nova 2i), which is pretty disappointing. Why? Because there’s no significant performance boost even though the P20 Lite is the latest from Huawei. That’s not saying the Kirin 659 is a bad processor but a new phone should have a better processor, especially since it’s part of the latest P20 series.


The unit I have for review has the highest configuration possible for the P20 Lite with 4GB of memory and 128GB of storage. The hybrid card slot accepts a microSD card just in case 128GB is not enough to store your files.


If you’re looking for a gaming phone, the P20 Lite might not be the best option in this range. The gaming side of the Kirin 659 is handled by the Mali-T830 MP2, a fairly okay graphics unit. What I mean by that is it can run games but not in their best state. PUBG Mobile runs in low settings while NBA 2K18 has to be somewhere in between low and medium. Still, it can play older graphics-intensive games in max settings like Asphalt Xtreme.


Android Oreo-based EMUI 8.0 is available out of the box which means you have the latest software Huawei has to offer. EMUI doesn’t differ that much from other Chinese-made interfaces that blend together iOS and Android experiences. For one, the app drawer is off by default, so the apps are available right on the home screen. The icons look a bit too playful for my liking, but I eventually got used to them. I must say though, EMUI 8.0 feels cluttered with inconsistent icons — some are rounded while some are squared. I hope Huawei comes up with a better UI soon which should be available as an update.


No quad-cameras, no Leica


One might mistake the P20 Lite as the regular P20 at first glance. That’s because they do look alike but the former has no Leica branding. Still, the P20 Lite is a capable phone for mobile photography. It has dual rear cameras — a combo of 16 and 2 megapixels with bokeh mode available.


Too bad the secondary sensor is just for analyzing depth in the image — not to shoot monochrome, extreme wide-angle, or for telephoto imaging. There are multiple modes available including “Pro photo” to manually set the camera settings.


Here are the samples from the rear camera:




The front camera is also equipped with a 16-megapixel sensor which easily makes the P20 Lite a contender in the selfie race. Like with other selfie-centric phones, the P20 Lite has built-in beauty mode but Huawei’s approach is more simple with just an option to choose from Level 1 to 10. A number of cute stickers are also available in the camera app.


Even without any Leica label to brag about, the P20 Lite can hold up on its own. The rear set captures good-looking images both in well-lit and low-light environments. Don’t expect it to excel in the dark, though; the f/2.2 aperture is not enough to make it see more than competing phones with a bright lens opening. Of course, the selfies are top-notch thanks to the number of megapixels the front sensor has. The beauty mode is a bit behind against OPPO’s and Vivo’s new midrange phones, but it works just fine.


Fast-charging and long-lasting


A sizeable 3000mAh battery is sealed inside the body of the phone. Through the USB-C port, the battery supports Huawei’s own fast charging technology. Thankfully, the phone comes with an 18W fast charger, so there’s no need to purchase a separate one. A quick 15-minute charge was able to give 17 percent of power while charging the phone for an hour provides up to 53 percent. A full charge took more than two hours — longer than expected.


A phone with a 3000mAh capacity should be able to last the whole day, and the P20 Lite definitely can. With my usage, a full charge lasted a whole day and that includes about four hours of screen on time. That’s also with mobile data and Wi-Fi turned on, making phone calls, social networking, music streaming, and picture taking. My everyday phone use is already considered heavy; with lighter usage the P20 Lite can even last longer.


Is this your GadgetMatch?


Unlike with the V9 and the F7, the P20 Lite is not much of an improvement from last year’s model. The phone might not be the direct successor of the Mate 10 Lite or Nova 2i, but I would have loved to see a spec bump rather than just a design overhaul.


Well, if you value design more, the P20 Lite’s premium build is its key selling point. It basically has the body of the regular P20 but with midrange specifications. The black variant I have here looks sleek and handsome, but there’s also a feminine option in Sakura Pink and a striking Klein Blue.

Honor View 20 review: No notch, no problem


Alternative to the Huawei Mate 20


Published


on

January 23, 2019

By

Marvin Velasco

If 2018 was all about smartphones adopting the notch, 2019 will be focused on eliminating the black cutout entirely. Brands like OPPO, Vivo, and Xiaomi jump-started the anti-trend by hiding the front camera behind sliders or pop-ups, but Honor has something more straightforward, and it’s on the flagship View 20.


There’s no standardized name for it yet — some call it a punch-hole camera and others named it hole-punch — but all you need to know is that the implementation is more visually pleasing than any form of notch.


For one, it’s much smaller than any other cutout and it’s placed in a more ideal spot — to the far left and not in between top-bar icons. In addition, the space around it is still LCD, eliminating any black space normally left behind by a notch.


Huawei and Samsung raced to get this type of phone out first, but even though Sammy launched ahead of the Nova 4 with the Galaxy A8s, it’s the Huawei sub-brand that brought it to international markets first. In addition, the View 20 is by far the most powerful of the three and arguably the most attractive.


While the Huawei Nova 4 looks a lot like the P20 Pro, the Honor View 20 goes for a more unique V-shaped pattern on the rear that shifts as you angle it differently towards a light source. Although it doesn’t help the ergonomics in any way, I can say that the phone is a pleasure to hold thanks to its curved glass rear.


The 6.4-inch 1080p LCD may seem overwhelming in size at first, but the tall aspect ratio helps provide a more manageable grip even for small hands. The fingerprint scanner’s rear placement is well-positioned, too. Combined with the fast face scanning, not once did I experience failed unlocking on the first attempt.


The View 20 is simply so enjoyable to play content on, whether it’s a movie from Netflix or game you’re addicted to. You’ll just have to deal with the different ways apps cover up the 4.5mm camera hole.


In some cases, the entire screen is filled up and you only have the black dot to ignore; other times, a big black bar can take up the entire edge, making the sides asymmetrical while viewing in landscape orientation. It’s not pretty, but you can get used to it.


Entire screen is utilized


Here are the asymmetrical black bars


You could argue that the placement isn’t ideal because it pushes the signal bar and notifications to the right, but Honor claims that this position is optimal. The basis is the Gutenberg Diagram, which says that eyes naturally fall to the top-left corner of an area called the primary optical area (POA). Eye motion then goes across and down to other sections. I’ll save my judgement for when I try Samsung’s upper-right positioning.


Design-wise, the only thing that really disappointed me was the lone speaker. Having gotten used to loud stereo speakers from recent smartphone reviews, going back to a cheap-sounding output to the right of the USB-C port feels like such a downgrade.


Fortunately, there’s a 3.5mm audio port for wired headphones; and if you already jumped on the wireless bandwagon, Bluetooth 5.0 is available for hassle-free audio. Both were vital to me in replacing the disappointing loudspeaker.


USB-C and the only loudspeaker


A rare 3.5mm port beside a set of sensors


The model I have is blessed with some of the best specs I could ask for in any smartphone to date: the same Kirin 980 chip found inside the Huawei Mate 20 series, a whopping 8GB of memory, and a total of 256GB of storage. Once you know how much this thing costs, you’ll be even more impressed.


Combined with Honor’s Magic 2.0.1 UI based on Android 9 Pie, this has to be one of the most fluid Android experiences for me. Of course, the software’s quirks are still present — such as the awkward double-press of the volume-down button to turn on the camera app and the lack of a swipe-up gesture to open the app drawer — but everything else from the updated volume adjustment to Digital Balance from Pie are available.


It goes without saying that the View 20 can tackle any app you throw at it, and thanks to the abundant memory and storage, you rarely have to worry about running out of space or having too many apps operating at once. It’s stable too, with no crashes for me so far. The navigation keys might randomly shift their location, but a restart always fixes that.


Yeah, they move to the left sometimes


As for gaming, GPU Turbo 2.0 is in place, applying itself to the following games: PUBG, Arena of Valor, Rules of Survival, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, Vainglory, and Asphalt 9: Legend. I was only able to test and compare with Asphalt 9; the gameplay was certainly buttery smooth, but I can’t say if it’s due to the latest version of GPU Turbo or because the Kirin 980 chip is simply that fast.


It helps that liquid cooling is built in so the View 20 doesn’t throttle and slow down under heavy load. In fact, I noticed how cool the phone was while gaming. There’s only one spot near the rear camera that gets noticeably warm during gameplay, though not enough to stop me from playing.


The only other time the handset heats up is while charging; however, that’s only because it charges so fast. It comes with a 22.5W SuperCharge adapter that brings the unit from zero to 55 percent in 30 minutes, 94 percent in an hour, and a full charge with an additional 15 minutes. These are fantastic numbers, especially since the View 20 can easily last over a day of usage with six hours of screen-on time on a single charge.


What I would say is missing, however, is wireless charging. It may be Honor’s way of cutting down on costs, but it’s something I miss nonetheless after having it on the Mate 20 series.


Finally, I have to talk about the cameras. While you could easily mistake the front shooter as the highlight — it’s inside a screen hole with 25 megapixels to its credit — it’s the 48-megapixel rear camera and its partnered 3D ToF (Time of Flight) sensor that do most of the magic.


By default, the built-in camera app outputs at 12 megapixels using data from the 48-megapixel sensor. While this may seem like a downgrade at first, the pixel cramming actually improves the detail and sharpness you get out of each photo. This also keeps the file size down to a much friendlier number.


However, if you want to maximize the potential of the image sensor, there’s a 48MP AI Ultra Clarity option which combines multiple shots into a more detailed picture. It’s a lot like the night mode Huawei pioneered, except it’s for daytime scenarios.


I tried it a few times, and to be honest, it’s not that useful. It takes longer to complete an exposure and moving objects become blurry during the process. On a smartphone screen, you can’t even appreciate the 8000 x 6000-pixel photos. It doesn’t help that the camera app goes back to the default 12MP setting each time you restart.


There are other features that take advantage of the 3D ToF sensor, but they either aren’t available yet or are exclusive to the Chinese market. You aren’t missing out though if you’re simply after good-looking photos.

As usual, there’s an option to activate AI for smarter scene detection. This is something I normally turned off on other Honor/Huawei phones because of how often the artificial intelligence would wrongly recognize an object or slow down the processing, but the View 20’s application is surprisingly good at this.


Not only can it detect more than one scene at a time — simultaneously optimizing for outdoor, beach, and sunset, for example — there’s no delay before or after taking the shot. Of course, you may still adjust settings even while AI is on. There were times when I would rather turn portrait mode off so I could keep the background blur-free around my subject.

Is this your GadgetMatch?


With the Huawei P30 coming soon and new flagships arriving during Mobile World Congress next month, now’s not a good time to invest in a premium smartphone.


However, the Honor View 20 is jam-packed with so many high-end specs and features that it’s difficult to resist. With a starting price of EUR 569 for the 6GB+128GB variant, it’s a steal compared to the Mate 20 series’ asking price.


It lacks a few things, specifically dual speakers, wireless charging, and proper water resistance, but those are negligible shortcomings if you apply the workarounds: use headphones or a speaker, take advantage of the incredible wired charging instead, and simply don’t use your phone near a pool or toilet.


If this is the standard Honor is setting in terms of design, performance, and price at the start of 2019, rival brands have to stay on their toes. Honor isn’t messing around.

Black Mirror’s Bandersnatch: A Discussion


Read this article or not, it’s your decision 😉


Published


on

January 6, 2019

By

If you’re into watching movies and TV shows about science fiction, chances are you’ve already heard of or seen the show Black Mirror and its latest episode/movie/game called Bandersnatch. It’s available to stream on Netflix and watching it gives the audience a unique experience in a way that doesn’t follow a linear way of storytelling.


Instead, it gives you the power to choose (using your TV’s remote control, laptop, or smartphone) and decide what happens next in the story. In short, there are many directions the narrative can branch out to and every choice affects what will happen later on.


It’s not the first time a story has been told in this approach, but the implementation in an online streaming service and how the events unfold throughout the episode goes beyond the norm in so many levels. If you’ve seen Bandersnatch, we’re sure there’s a lot you want to talk about. And so do we! This article is a discussion on what we liked and didn’t like.


Of course, there will be spoilers throughout. If you haven’t seen the episode, you may stop reading and watch it first. Or you can just continue on and join in on the fun. All up to you. It’s not like someone from the future is controlling your decisions, right?


Were there any expectations before watching Black Mirror‘s Bandersnatch?


Dan: I have to admit that I was hyped for Bandersnatch. It became sort of a tradition for me to binge watch a new season Black Mirror during the holidays. So, when the news broke about an interactive Black Mirror film, I had high expectations. I expected it to be more complex, but I think it was just enough.


Rodneil: When I played the first three hours of the PlayStation 4 exclusive Detroit: Become Human,my initial thought was that it felt like binging a Netflix series with more involvement from you as the audience. In that regard, I expected Bandersnatch to feel like a game, and it did.


Kevin: I expected it to be a dark, heavy episode since it’s what Black Mirror excels at. As for the interactive experience, I’ve recently tried out Netflix’s Minecraft Story Mode and had a taste of how the system works so I already had an idea of how things will go.


What was your first ending?


Dan: I took the initial offer immediately… It wasn’t done in good judgment. 👀


Rodneil: Same with Dan, haha. My gut said to not take the offer but logically, it felt like a reasonable option. After choosing this “wrong path,” I followed my gut the rest of the way.


Kevin: I took the prescription pills prescribed by my shrink (I’d like to think I’m obedient that way) instead of flushing them down the toilet which resulted in getting a 2/5 stars rating of my game. I went for a different timeline, of course, and corrected that.


Did you make good decisions throughout the story?


Dan: Not really. Instead of thoroughly thinking about which option I choose, I always had the thought that I can repeat and amend a mistake. Also, I thought of it as a video game wherein I have to make sure I explore everything before jumping to the next level.


Kevin: I didn’t want to “shout at dad” let alone “kill dad.” So those decisions led me to a dead end. Then I remembered this is Black Mirror and it probably wanted me to go for a darker path. It did, haha!


Rodneil: I’m not sure about good but I did go with what I thought was the smarter or weirder option.


Do you think your decisions reflect your personality?


Dan: It should. Although, I think I wasn’t properly watching it the first time, so my first choices should not be counted.


Rodneil: For the second ending I got, I would say it did. My usual approach in choose-your-adventure games is to not think too much about my choices and just go with my gut.


Kevin: It did. And as I said earlier, some of those choices led me to a dead end. Others made things more interesting like taking on the therapist Street Fighter style. That was fun to watch.


What was your favorite part from the episode?


Dan: I’d say my favorite part was one of the proper endings where the young Stefan went with her Mommy and they got into the train accident. It was just a flashback, but it affected the current timeline of adult Stefan and he died while sitting on a chair inside his doctor’s office. Being part of the Black Mirror franchise, I find this ending to be the best as it embraces the series’ suspenseful and dark atmosphere.


Kevin: There were actually a lot for me. The conspiracy theories Colin delivered while they were tripping on LSD was so convincing thanks to his acting.


The path where you choose to explain Netflix to Stefan, for me, was just so surreal since I could imagine myself telling someone from the 80s that I’m controlling a fictional character on a TV show. I bet hearing that from someone from the future would totally sound insane — and for us living in the present, it is the reality.


Also, that part when Stefan says something about making the audience think they have free will to choose but in reality, it’s still Stefan giving the scenarios and where they’re heading. It pretty much applies to us, too, thinking we have control over the entire episode when there’s actually a flowchart of things that dictate what we can and cannot do.


Lastly, I’d say I was blown away by how meta the episode can become. One ending goes to follow Colin’s daughter who is now adapting Bandersnatch for Netflix. We see her planning the choices for the actual episode and we’re given one last time to dictate what she does next. Eventually, she destroys her computer which then makes the show nonexistent. Brilliant.


Rodneil: Man, I agree with everything Kevin listed. I enjoyed Colin’s entire “free will” monologue and how meta it was when you’re asked to explain Netflix to Stefan.


Is there anything that you didn’t like about the story or experience?


Dan: As I have mentioned earlier, I was expecting a more in-depth viewer involvement. There were decisions made by the protagonist that I wished I was given the chance to choose. Also, it was not the strongest Black Mirror story. But, overall, Bandersnatch is a showcase of online entertainment. It may not be the most original, but the concept was put to good use.


Rodneil: Nothing in particular. I wasn’t expecting much coming into it. In fact, I didn’t expect the story to be good at all, but after watching, I thought it was a perfect first offering for this kind of format.


Kevin: Dan and I share the same sentiments on the episode not having the strongest story. I mentioned that I expected something heavy before watching it and though some of the endings were indeed dark, it’s not Black-Mirror-Season-One-Episode-One dark that will leave you dumbfounded by the end. I understand that they concentrated more on the interactive part and they did a fantastic job in its entirety.


Will this interactive technology change or affect how we watch movies and TV series in the future?


Dan: A big yes. Like with interactive books, however, it’s not for everyone and it’s not applicable to all titles. I’d love to see a couple of interactive films on Netflix every now and then, especially on the big screen. The genre of Black Mirror is perfect for interactive content, and maybe some other horror or suspense stories. Stretching this out to a series will take a lot of resources, but it’ll be grand.


Rodneil: It will change in that I think other streaming channels and even platforms like YouTube and Facebook will try to integrate this feature. It might be one way to curb piracy. I imagine it will be extremely hard to duplicate this experience. If more good titles make use of this interactive kind of viewing then more people might be enticed to actually pay for streaming services. We’re a long way away from that but this is definitely a step in the right direction.


Kevin: Of course. It has that element that you’re responsible for what happens to the character — whether something good happens to them or you get them killed. It has a different, more personal impact. Also, what Dan and Rodneil said.
