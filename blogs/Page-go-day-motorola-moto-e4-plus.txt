If you’re in the market for a cellphone that will keep up with you all day—and beyond—we’ve got just what you’re looking for: Motorola’s powerful new Moto E4 Plus is now available from Consumer Cellular. It’s priced at just $125, so you’re sure to be impressed by how much smartphone you’re getting!


The big news is its long-lasting power, driven by an advanced 5,000mAh battery. This delivers up to 48 hours of mixed use on a single charge, and if that’s not enough, there’s even a 10W rapid charger included for those times when you need a quick extra boost.


And you’ll want to use every minute of that power: the E4 Plus will let you multi-task with impressive ease. Whether you’re watching video or using apps and social media, the Android™ 7.1 operating system and 1.4GHz quad-core processor deliver smooth, fast performance.


A large 5.5” HD display is perfect for capturing and viewing great photos with the 13MP rear camera, which includes superior low-light image quality. The Moto E4 Plus also comes equipped with a handy fingerprint sensor for added security, and water-repellent coating to help guard against those unexpected splashes and spills.


It’s plenty of smartphone, with power to spare—and from one of the most respected names in the business! You can learn more about the Motorola Moto E4 Plus in the video below.

    What king of memory does this phone have? If the phone has memory, can it be upgraded? Does this phone have a light built in?
    I have a MOTO G phone now and live in a condo but my phone keeps saying mobile network not available. Will I have the same problem with the phone listed above? It is a pain when you are not able to make and receive call unless you power down and then turn the phone on again. If the phone able will not stop that what will?

    I just received my Doro 825 SmartEasy! I started with a Doro 626, upgraded to Huawei, now this one. The flip wasn’t enough, the Huawei seemed too complicated for my old brain. This one, I was a little afraid of, until I asked your rep for help. She was so patient and walked me through everything. I now feel like my phone is friendly and I’ll keep it around for a long time. Thanks for everthing!!

    Can you assign different ring tones to different people for phones calls and texts?

        October 24, 2017 at 11:35 am

        Thanks for asking, Diana! You can do this with the Moto E4 Plus pretty easily. Once you have a contact saved to your phone, you’ll want to tap it, then select the option to “Edit Contact”. From there, you can select the menu in the top right corner, and select “Set ringtone”. If you run into any issues with making these changes, we’re happy to help you over the phone at 888-345-5509. We appreciate you taking the time to post, and we hope you have a lovely day!

    How do I move my stored pictures, etc., from my current phone to a new one?


    reply to Judith

      + Ashley at Consumer Cellular says
        October 24, 2017 at 9:57 am

        Great question, Judith! There are a few different options, depending on the type of phone you have. If both of your devices have an SD slot, you can save photos and music to the SD card, then transfer the card to your new device. If you need to move your contacts, you can usually do that quite easily by placing your old SIM card into your new phone, then importing the contacts. We’re happy to talk with you about your options and even walk you through this if you like. Just call us at 888-345-5509, and we’ll be ready to assist you. Thank you for taking the time to post today!

    My first smartphone is the Samsung j3. I like it, want to upgrade. On c.c what phone would you suggest i should get .would the apps be transferred to the new phone? Also my pictures.

        Great question, Gaynel! If you like the way your Samsung J3 works, you may want to continue with another Android phone. All Android phones use a similar operating system, and use the same Gmail account you already have. That way, your apps, contacts and even photos will be easily transferred from one phone to another. As for which new phone would be the best choice, it really depends on how you use your phone. For example, if you’re looking for a large screen and long battery life, the Moto G5 Plus is an excellent choice. If you want the absolute best option available, with a huge screen and a built-in stylus, our new Samsung Galaxy Note8 may be the right fit. We’re happy to answer any questions you have or help you place an order at 888-345-5509. Thank you for taking the time to post, and we can’t wait to hear which phone you choose!
