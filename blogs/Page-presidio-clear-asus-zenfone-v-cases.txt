With an ultra-slim design and superior impact protection, Presidio™ CLEAR is a premium clear Asus ZenFone™ V case unlike any other.


Presidio CLEAR has a hard exterior layer that disperses force and an interior layer of IMPACTIUM™ CLEAR that absorbs and disperses shock away from your device.


Presidio CLEAR is drop tested from 8 feet multiple times by a third-party laboratory to test its superior protection from an extreme height, so you can be confident it will hold up to everyday drops. All Speck cases, including Presidio CLEAR, are tested for scratch-resistance, chemical resistance, and precision fit.


Presidio CLEAR is designed to stand up to everyday wear and tear. The materials used in the case resist UV yellowing to keep them looking clear for the life of the case. Our clear ZenFone V cases also have a special coating that resists scratches.


Presidio is our slimmest line of cases yet, adding 20 percent less bulk to your phone than previous CandyShell cases. We’ve removed all excess material without sacrificing protection.


All Presidio cases come with a lifetime limited warranty.


Completely clear Asus ZenFone™ V cases with IMPACTIUM™ CLEAR.


Protection

  * 8-Foot Drop Tested. Our Presidio™ Asus ZenFone V cases have been dropped from a height of 8 feet multiple times by third-party laboratories to ensure they offer superior protection.
  * IMPACTIUM CLEAR. IMPACTIUM CLEAR is a dynamic shock-absorbing material that absorbs and disperses force away from your Asus ZenFone AR.
  * Patented raised-bezel screen protection. IMPACTIUM CLEAR raised bezel guards screen from direct drops onto phone face and prevents damage when lying flat.
  * Responsive button protection. IMPACTIUM CLEAR protects volume and power buttons while maintaining true button responsiveness.
  * Perimeter port and camera protection. IMPACTIUM CLEAR protects ports, microphone, and speakers from drops without compromising acoustics or interfering with port accessibility, camera lenses or the camera flash.

Design

  * Dual-layer design. Presidio CLEAR features a polycarbonate outer shell and inner IMPACTIUM CLEAR rubber layer for robust protection.
  * Slimmest and most protective case yet. We’ve optimized the design to create the slimmest case Speck has ever made, while improving protection.
  * Precision-engineered fit. Presidio CLEAR is precision-engineered to fit your Asus ZenFone V perfectly.

Quality

  * Scratch-resistant. Presidio CLEAR resists scratches and offers a modern style with a clear glossy design.
  * Resists UV Yellowing. Presidio CLEAR’s custom-engineered material, IMPACTIUM CLEAR, resists turning yellow when exposed to UV light from the sun.
  * Lab-tested durability. All Speck cases are independently lab tested for multiple real-life situations to ensure your device is always protected. We test to protect against extreme drops, extreme temperatures, chemicals, antenna interference, cracks and abrasions, device bending, and more.
  * Lifetime warranty. This Presidio case comes with a lifetime limited warranty. For full terms visit: speckproducts.com/warranty
