    I see that AC have just voted our N7.1's as the best budget phone of 2018.
    
    Seems to back up my choice of new device.
    
    EDIT : Should read "affordable". Not budget.

    N7.1 has been a good fit for me. As oneplus is finding, carriers are still key for volume in the US. Pixel lite could put the squeeze on any midrangers over $300.

    Yes, it will be interesting to see what the pricing is on the Lite.

    Don't expect any logical pricing on Pixel Lite. Besides, Nokia 7.1 has advantages over Pixel like headphone jack and micro SD card slot.

    Agreed, the two things I cannot do without.
