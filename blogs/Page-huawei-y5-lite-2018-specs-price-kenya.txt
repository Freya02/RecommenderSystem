Huawei launched the Huawei Y5 Lite (2018) in the country early last week featuring some entry-level specifications. Huawei is selling the device at Ksh.9,999 making it one of the least expensive phones in Huawei’s Y series.


During the launch, Steven Li, Head of Eastern Africa Mobile at Huawei said the market is growing and consumers spending habits are changing in terms of value for money. ‘’The introduction of the Y5 Lite (2018) in the market is therefore part of our strategy to target low end users who are looking for a budget device that offers unique experience that meets their needs and requirement.”


With the Huawei Y5 Lite (2018), the company is targeting a vital market in Kenya that has been dominated by brands like Infinix, Tecno, Itel and others.


“The market has been competitive with the introduction of devices by other players in the market. As Huawei, we are keen on ensuring that our devices which we launch in the market are value for money making them more favorable in the already congested market. The launch of this device comes at a time when everyone is looking for a Christmas gift for their loved ones, it is an ideal gift for gifting people in your lives,” he added.
